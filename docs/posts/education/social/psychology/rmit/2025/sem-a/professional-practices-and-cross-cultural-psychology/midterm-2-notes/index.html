<h2>Case Study</h2>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Suggest a culturally-appropriate treatment strategy for the following case study</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Patient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria, a 30-year-old female; is a [strict] Roman Catholic; has migrated from a rural region of Peru [South America] just over a year ago; is married; and, the parent of two school-age children. Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychotherapy visit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant client background/history</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinical diagnosis</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).</li>
<li>High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultural Context and Migration Stressors</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.</li>
<li>A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Week 06 - Multi-cultural issues</h2>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 1: What is cultural diversity, its relevance to Australia and to professional psychology</h3>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 2: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity</h3>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 3: What is migration stress and evaluate acculturation strategies to decrease stress</h3>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 4: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society</h3>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 5: What is cultural competence and explain its training and evaluation</h3>
<h2>Week 08 - Explaining stigma</h2>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 1: Explain the emerging conceptualization of human behaviour</h3>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 2: Discuss DSM 5 in terms of development, general issues raised during development and the issue of pathologizing normal behaviour</h3>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 3: Theoretically explain how DSM labels help create stigma toward people with mental health problems</h3>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 4: Explain public and self-stigma and discuss strategies for changing stigma</h3>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 5: Discuss the future role of psychology in the area of stigma</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social Structures
<ul>
<li>Most research that examines stigma focuses on the impact at the individual psychological level – this reinforces the idea of “blaming the victim” and focuses on individual clinical intervention – for example, understanding individual factors in help-seeking behaviour [gender, literacy etc]</li>
<li>For the most part, studies have ignored the fact that stigma is inherent in the social structures that make up society.</li>
<li>Stigma is evident in the way laws, social services, and the justice system are structured as well as ways in which resources are allocated.</li>
<li>Research and interventions that focuses on the social structures that maintain stigma and strategies for changing them are required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenges include:
<ul>
<li>Determine the cost-benefit analysis of labelling mental illness</li>
<li>Determine the impact/problem of pathologizing the normal</li>
<li>Problem with modern Western societies seeking pleasure and avoiding both physical and psychological pain</li>
<li>Chronic use of medication [both physical and mental health] to treat symptoms [and not the cure problems]</li>
<li>Identifying an effective strategy to remove stigma from society</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Week 09 - Big issues/Wicked problems</h2>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 1: Identifying and tackling big issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Psychology as a [pure] discipline
<ul>
<li>Has defined itself as the science of human behaviour</li>
<li>Assumed that the focus of behaviour would be at the individual level</li>
<li>The original areas of study
<ul>
<li>Human brain</li>
<li>Human information processing</li>
<li>Human genome</li>
<li>Human personality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reinforced the focus on the internal determinants of an individual’s behaviour</li>
<li>Lead to the assumptions of universality of traits and the over-reliance of quantitative methodology and ETIC research</li>
<li>Ignore the saying "No Man is an Island"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Psychology as an [applied] discipline
<ul>
<li>Pre-1920s
<ul>
<li>Focused on explaining philosophical issues</li>
<li>Focused on theory and explanation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1920s
<ul>
<li>added the development and evaluation of psychological assessments</li>
<li>Began with intelligence testing, but then to selection and then all individual differences [personality, motivation, skills, etc]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1950s
<ul>
<li>Psychopathology – development of DSM classification systems – but not intervention, just psych assessment and description</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue to focus on normal vs abnormal individual and ignore the role of environment</li>
<li>1960s
<ul>
<li>While still supporting the medical profession [Behavioural medicine] began to develop interventions</li>
<li>Interventions however were developed by
<ul>
<li>Personality psychologists – applying theory of the normal to the abnormal</li>
<li>Focused on individual behavioural [and then cognitive] change</li>
<li>Psychological assessments that determined the abnormal and could measure successful change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interventions were
<ul>
<li>Consistent with the philosophy of focussing on individuals</li>
<li>Consistent with the philosophy of universalism</li>
<li>Were located in clinics and therefore ignored the environment</li>
<li>Plagued by dominance of medical profession [biology over cognitions]</li>
<li>Low success rates: high attrition rates, low adherence, high relapse [see second year Applied Social Psychology]</li>
<li>Treating the symptoms and not the cause</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences
<ul>
<li>Medicine and the medical model continue to dominate</li>
<li>Psychology continued to focus on the individual</li>
<li>Society’s physical and mental health problems  persisted [and in many cases got worse] – especially depression and suicide</li>
<li>Psychology with its individual focus
<ul>
<li>psycho-pathologised the patient [they were abnormal-not society]</li>
<li>blaming the victim – created mental health stigma</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1960s – 1970s
<ul>
<li>Social psychological research began – but not with major explanations of human behaviour – but with remarkable experiments</li>
<li>Asch conformity</li>
<li>Milgram obedience</li>
<li>Zimbardo power of environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Study</h2>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Suggest a culturally-appropriate treatment strategy for the following case study</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Patient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria, a 30-year-old female; is a [strict] Roman Catholic; has migrated from a rural region of Peru [South America] just over a year ago; is married; and, the parent of two school-age children. Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychotherapy visit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant client background/history</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinical diagnosis</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).</li>
<li>High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultural Context and Migration Stressors</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.</li>
<li>A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Maria’s strict Roman Catholic faith may cause guilt and reluctance to seek help for suicidal thoughts. From rural Peru’s collectivist, high power distance culture, she likely accepts her husband’s controlling behavior due to traditional family roles. Recent migration adds stress, isolation, and language barriers. Her tiredness, appetite loss, and sleep problems reflect depression, possibly expressed somatically. Avoiding eye contact and difficulty sharing emotions align with cultural norms of modesty. Her hopelessness signals severe depression and powerlessness.</p>
<p>Dr. C should respectfully integrate Maria’s strict Roman Catholic faith into therapy, exploring spirituality as a source of strength and, if appropriate, involving pastoral support. Utilizing culturally sensitive language and connecting her with Peruvian community or women’s groups can reduce stigma and enhance engagement. Therapy should prioritize trust, patience, and respect for her collectivist, rural background, empowering Maria within her cultural values while gently supporting her autonomy and recovery.</p>
<h2>Week 06 - Multi-cultural issues</h2>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 1: What is cultural diversity, its relevance to Australia and to professional psychology</h3>
<p>Culture is distinct from diversity, though often confused with it. While diversity includes variables like gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, and socioeconomic status, culture refers to shared behaviors, customs, values, and learned knowledge within a society. Multiculturalism emphasizes peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among different cultural groups. In psychology, culture shapes development, cognition, personality, psychopathology, and therapeutic needs. Concepts such as ethnocentrism (judging others by one’s cultural standards), cultural relativism (understanding behaviors in their own cultural context), and cultural universals (traits common across all cultures) help contextualize cultural impacts. The tripartite model further explains how individuals are influenced at the unique, group, and universal levels.</p>
<p>Australia exemplifies cultural diversity, with around 40% of its population being immigrants or their children, and 15% speaking a language other than English at home. This diversity challenges the ethnocentric assumptions of Western psychology, which often overlooks cultural context by focusing on individualism and internal causes of mental illness. Professional psychologists are increasingly called to develop cultural competence, acknowledging that Western-based theories, diagnostic tools like the DSM-5, and therapies like CBT may not universally apply. Cross-cultural psychology underscores the importance of training psychologists to address cultural differences to ensure equitable and effective psychological care.</p>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 2: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity</h3>
<p>This presentation explores the cultural influences on the diagnosis and understanding of mental illness. It outlines four major theoretical causes of abnormal behaviour and highlights the limitations of using Western diagnostic systems, like the DSM-5, universally. While schizophrenia is biologically consistent across cultures (etic), its prevalence and outcomes vary significantly due to cultural and social factors (emic). WHO studies found better outcomes in developing nations, attributed to stronger community support and less reliance on medical models. Factors like individualism, access to healthcare, and stigma further influence how mental illnesses manifest and are treated globally.</p>
<p>The presentation critiques the DSM-5’s assumptions of universality, noting its ethnocentric bias. Although it attempts to incorporate cultural elements, such as through symptom limits and cultural notes, it still primarily reflects Western norms. The existence of culture-bound syndromes—mental disorders recognized only in specific cultures—challenges the idea that DSM categories are universal. Alternative systems, like China’s CCMD-3, demonstrate the value of emic approaches and support a more culturally inclusive model of mental health classification.</p>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 3: What is migration stress and evaluate acculturation strategies to decrease stress</h3>
<p>Researchers have proposed five hypotheses to explain the high rates of schizophrenia among migrant groups, including refugees. The first hypothesis—that countries of origin have high schizophrenia rates—lacks evidence. The second suggests self-selection, where individuals predisposed to mental illness are more likely to migrate; this is only partially true. The third hypothesis claims migration stress causes schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals, but data shows the onset peaks 10–12 years post-migration, not immediately. The fourth posits that high rates are due to misdiagnosis by host clinicians, but most studies assess symptoms directly, not diagnoses. The fifth hypothesis, which is somewhat supported, argues that cultural incongruity and ethnic density lead to acculturative stress, learned helplessness, and increased mental illness, particularly among marginalized migrant communities.</p>
<p>Enculturation refers to learning and internalizing one’s original cultural norms, often from childhood. Acculturation occurs when individuals migrate and begin adapting to a new national culture. Acculturation strategies influence mental health outcomes. <em>Integration</em>—accepting both original and host cultures—is linked to better support and access to services. In contrast, <em>marginalization</em>—rejecting both cultures—is associated with poorer outcomes, including limited community support and reduced access to mental health care. Afghan refugees, for example, often report high levels of depression and anxiety, especially when they experience marginalization due to forced displacement and cultural disconnection.</p>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 4: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society</h3>
<p>This presentation compares two models of psychological intervention: the traditional welfare state model (etic) and the service provision model (emic). The welfare model applies standardized, cost-effective approaches across diverse populations, often ignoring cultural relevance. For example, a standardized parenting program in a Vietnamese community failed due to cultural mismatch, as concepts like parent training were unfamiliar and uncomfortable. The emic service model, in contrast, emphasizes cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, even if it is more resource-intensive, to ensure programs are beneficial to all communities.</p>
<p>It also offers a comparative analysis of Western psychotherapies—Psychoanalysis, Humanistic, and CBT—and contrasts them with Naikan therapy, a Japanese collectivist approach. CBT, shaped by individualistic Western values, focuses on internal faults and rewards productivity, sometimes contributing to mental illness stigma. Naikan therapy emphasizes introspection, gratitude, and social interdependence, rooted in Buddhist and collectivist beliefs. It encourages self-reflection through structured questions and may offer unique therapeutic value, though its applicability across cultures and disorders remains debatable.</p>
<h3>Week 06 - Objective 5: What is cultural competence and explain its training and evaluation</h3>
<p>Cultural competence in psychotherapy involves four key skills: admission of limitations, self-awareness, cultural knowledge, and clinical application. For therapy to be effective, clients must perceive the therapist as culturally understanding, which strengthens the therapeutic relationship, encourages disclosure, and improves adherence to treatment. Therapists must recognize their limitations—highlighted by the Dunning-Kruger effect—since overestimating competence can alienate clients and reduce treatment success. Self-awareness is essential, requiring therapists to reflect on their own cultural values and biases shaped through enculturation. Tools like Bronfenbrenner's systems and Hofstede’s dimensions help psychologists understand their worldview and compare it to their clients', reducing ethnocentric judgments.</p>
<p>Cultural knowledge enables therapists to develop culturally appropriate skills in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes adapting Western therapies and considering cultural or religious norms that affect therapy’s acceptability. Training programs must integrate multicultural content throughout all areas of psychology and evaluate cultural competence alongside clinical skills. Diverse student recruitment and culturally-informed teaching staff are also essential. Including multicultural or Indigenous placements ensures that graduates are prepared to provide competent and sensitive care in diverse settings.</p>
<h2>Week 08 - Explaining stigma</h2>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 1: Explain the emerging conceptualization of human behaviour</h3>
<p>The conceptualization of human behaviour began with categorizing people by traits like gender, age, and size—initially as neutral differences. As psychology developed, it introduced hypothetical constructs such as intelligence to better understand and assess behaviour. Alfred Binet pioneered intelligence testing to identify children needing special education, which evolved from binary categories into measurable continuums like the normal curve. Eventually, statistical deviations were culturally evaluated, with higher scores seen as desirable and lower scores as less desirable. This gave rise to labels like “idiot” or “moron,” which shifted over time to more neutral terms such as “intellectual disability” as public usage turned derogatory.</p>
<p>These labels, while intended to objectively describe behaviour, became attached to individuals, attracting stereotypes that influence how society treats them. For example, people with mental illness may be stereotyped as dangerous, leading to social avoidance, reduced employment opportunities, or institutionalization. Such responses, even when framed as help, often result in benevolent discrimination, reinforcing stigma and limiting inclusion.</p>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 2: Discuss DSM 5 in terms of development, general issues raised during development and the issue of pathologizing normal behaviour</h3>
<p>The DSM, originally developed to classify and diagnose abnormal behaviour for targeted treatment, has evolved from hypothetical constructs to symptom-based criteria for greater reliability. However, its validity remains debated, especially under pressures from the anti-psychiatry movement and pharmaceutical influence. DSM-5 faces criticism for expanding diagnoses to pathologize normal behaviours, contributing to high prevalence rates of mental illness in the population. Moreover, it operates as an EMIC (US-based) system imposed globally (ETIC), and is seen more as a political document than a scientific one. Its reliance on clinical opinion, rather than empirical evidence, undermines individual and cultural differences, reinforcing a biased and often exclusionary framework.</p>
<p>Critiques highlight gender, socioeconomic, age, and LGBTI+ biases within the DSM. Females, the elderly, the poor, and sexual minorities often face misdiagnosis due to sociocultural prejudices codified as mental illness. These diagnostic practices favour a Western, male-dominated worldview, ignoring broader environmental or systemic factors. Ultimately, while the DSM offers clinical utility, it also reinforces stigmatization and marginalization, privileging pharmaceutical treatments and distancing therapists from clients’ lived realities.</p>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 3: Theoretically explain how DSM labels help create stigma toward people with mental health problems</h3>
<p>Historically, mental health professionals significantly contributed to the stigmatization of homosexuality by labeling it as a disorder. In the 1950s, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental illness, legitimizing discrimination. This label, lacking scientific evidence, harmed the emerging gay rights movement and justified harmful practices like conversion therapy. The APA’s eventual removal of this classification, followed by the World Health Organization’s 1990 decision to eliminate homosexuality from the ICD, marked a shift away from medicalized discrimination.</p>
<p>Since then, progress has been made in repealing sodomy laws, securing workplace protections, enabling military service, marriage equality, and adoption rights for LGBTI+ people. The mental health field also shifted its focus toward understanding the needs of LGBTI+ individuals, recognizing that social stigma, not homosexuality, contributes to mental health risks. Research shows that ongoing discrimination leads to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders among lesbians and gay males, reflecting the enduring impact of stigma.</p>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 4: Explain public and self-stigma and discuss strategies for changing stigma</h3>
<p>This presentation explores the impact of stigma on individuals with mental illness, distinguishing between <strong>public stigma</strong> - society’s negative perceptions—and <strong>self-stigma</strong>, where individuals internalize these attitudes. Public stigma is built on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, leading to social avoidance, job and housing exclusion, and coercive treatment. Self-stigma can result in low self-esteem, depression, and learned helplessness, although some individuals respond with righteous anger, using stigma as motivation to advocate for better services and equality. Cultural examples, like the treatment of albinism in some societies, highlight how arbitrary and harmful stigmas can be.</p>
<p>To combat public stigma, four main strategies are discussed: <strong>protest</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>contact</strong>, and <strong>integration</strong>. Protest challenges harmful portrayals but doesn’t change attitudes. Education helps reduce stigma through factual understanding. Contact with individuals who have mental illness helps humanize and reduce fear. Integration, involving collaborative efforts between patients, families, and professionals, fosters inclusion but remains limited due to systemic segregation in health systems. Alternative models—<strong>medicalization</strong> and <strong>normalization</strong>—offer competing ways to reduce stigma through redefining or removing psychiatric labels.</p>
<h3>Week 08 - Objective 5: Discuss the future role of psychology in the area of stigma</h3>
<p>Most stigma research tends to focus on individual psychological factors—such as gender or literacy—particularly in the context of help-seeking behavior. This approach can unintentionally reinforce a “blame the victim” narrative and promote clinical interventions aimed solely at the individual. However, stigma is not just a personal issue; it is deeply embedded within the broader social structures that shape society, such as laws, social services, and the justice system. These structures influence how resources are distributed and often perpetuate systemic disadvantage.</p>
<p>To address stigma effectively, research and interventions must shift toward examining and transforming these underlying social structures. Key challenges include evaluating the cost-benefit of labeling mental illness, understanding the risks of pathologizing normal behavior, and confronting the cultural norm in Western societies of avoiding discomfort—both physical and psychological. Moreover, the widespread use of medication to manage symptoms without tackling root causes contributes to the problem. A major priority is to develop and implement strategies that reduce stigma at both individual and societal levels.</p>
<h2>Week 09 - Big issues/Wicked problems</h2>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 1: Identifying and tackling big issues</h3>
<p>Psychology has traditionally defined itself as the science of human behaviour, focusing largely on the individual. From its early emphasis on the brain, information processing, and personality, psychology reinforced internal, universal explanations for behaviour while sidelining environmental and societal influences. As an applied field, it shifted from philosophical inquiry to assessments and diagnosis, especially from the 1920s onward. However, psychological interventions, dominated by medical models and personality theories, continued to treat symptoms rather than causes. With limited success, the field often stigmatized individuals as abnormal without addressing broader societal problems. Despite pivotal social experiments in the 1960s and 70s, psychology has lacked a comprehensive bio-psychosocial theory and remained mostly silent on major social issues like poverty and domestic violence.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is a complex, multifaceted form of abuse occurring in both heterosexual and same-sex relationships, often involving physical, emotional, economic, or sexual harm. Women are disproportionately the victims, while men are typically the perpetrators. Root causes include patriarchal social structures, intergenerational abuse, drug and alcohol use, gender roles, and failures in the criminal justice system. Psychology often misattributes the issue to individual pathology, such as personality disorders or victim weakness, rather than confronting systemic inequalities. As a "wicked problem," domestic violence resists simple solutions—many interventions may have limited impact or unintended consequences unless they also target the broader societal and political structures that sustain gender inequality and power imbalances.</p>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 2: What is a wicked problem: definition and parameters</h3>
<p>Wicked problems are complex, socially embedded issues that are difficult or impossible to solve definitively. Coined by Rittel and Webber, the concept highlights that these problems have many causes and interdependencies—solving one part can reveal or create new problems. Wicked problems lack a clear definition, have no stopping point, and require more than scientific methods; they involve social policy, changing constraints, and conflicting stakeholder views in a pluralistic society.</p>
<p>In contrast to tame problems—which are clearly defined, linear, and solvable through expert-driven analysis—wicked problems are dynamic and resist simple solutions. Their framing depends on the proposed solution, and outcomes are unpredictable or subjective. Psychology, traditionally successful with tame problems, struggles with wicked ones due to their applied, community-based nature, lack of objective variables, and the need for creative, interdisciplinary approaches. Addressing wicked problems requires ongoing collaboration, flexible thinking, and acknowledgment of competing values and interests.</p>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 3: Using the example of "Domestic violence“, explain the 10 characteristics of a wicked problem</h3>
<ol>
<li>No definitive formulation: Domestic violence lacks a single definition—psychologists, sociologists, and legal experts each frame it differently based on their worldview.</li>
<li>No stopping rule: There’s no clear point at which domestic violence is “solved”; efforts often stop due to limits in time or resources.</li>
<li>Solutions are better or worse, not true or false: Responses are judged by varying standards across disciplines, not by objective correctness.</li>
<li>No ultimate test: Effects of interventions (e.g., tougher laws) may take years to show, and unintended consequences may surface later.</li>
<li>One-shot operation: Each policy has lasting impact—trial-and-error is too risky when human lives are involved.</li>
<li>No full list of solutions: Not all causes or interventions are known; solutions must be flexible and evolving.</li>
<li>Each is essentially unique: Domestic violence shares features with other problems but also presents unique sociocultural challenges.</li>
<li>Symptom of another problem: It reflects broader issues like gender inequality or cultural norms.</li>
<li>Explanations determine solutions: How the problem is framed influences proposed interventions.</li>
<li>No right to be wrong: Practitioners and policymakers are accountable for outcomes—ethical caution is crucial.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 4: What is a mind map: definition and creation of mind maps</h3>
<p>A mind map is a visual tool used to organize information hierarchically, highlighting the relationships between different ideas. It typically begins with a central concept—such as gender inequality—and branches into related ideas, like male gender toxicity, and more distal examples, such as domestic violence. Mind maps are useful for generating, linking, and classifying ideas, and are commonly used for tasks like essay writing, decision-making, and course planning. They are also valuable in addressing “tame” problems and brainstorming “wicked” problems, where multiple stakeholders contribute individual mind maps that are later integrated to explore complex solutions.</p>
<p>Research on undergraduate students shows that mind maps significantly improve understanding and memory recall compared to traditional methods like reading or attending lectures. They help students engage more deeply with material and organize concepts more effectively. Interestingly, mind maps may be especially helpful for low-ability students who benefit from the visual structure, while high-ability students may already mentally visualize these connections without needing a physical map.</p>
<h3>Week 09 - Objective 5: Explain the three major strategies to progress the resolution of wicked problems</h3>
<p>Wicked problems are complex and lack clear definitions, making them unsuitable for traditional, step-by-step problem-solving methods. Instead, they require flexible approaches that can adapt to evolving challenges and multiple perspectives. Each strategy has trade-offs depending on the context of the wicked problem. Three main strategies are used to tackle wicked problems: authoritative, competitive, and collaborative. These aim to manage, not necessarily solve, the issues.</p>
<p>The authoritative strategy places control in the hands of a few experts, reducing complexity by limiting stakeholder involvement. However, this can overlook important perspectives. An example is the Northern Territory Intervention, where top-down policies were applied to Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The competitive strategy pits groups against each other to generate solutions, encouraging variety but risking conflict and poor cooperation.</p>
<p>The collaborative strategy involves all stakeholders in finding a shared solution, improving commitment and implementation. Yet, it is time-consuming and vulnerable to failure, especially with inconsistent government support.</p>

Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePsychotherapy visit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings.

From rural Peru’s collectivist, high power distance culture, she likely accepts her husband’s controlling behavior due to traditional family roles. Recent migration adds stress, isolation, and language barriers. Her tiredness, appetite loss, and sleep problems reflect depression, possibly expressed somatically. Avoiding eye contact and difficulty sharing emotions align with cultural norms of modesty. Her hopelessness signals severe depression and powerlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. C should respectfully integrate Maria’s strict Roman Catholic faith into therapy, exploring spirituality as a source of strength and, if appropriate, involving pastoral support. Utilizing culturally sensitive language and connecting her with Peruvian community or women’s groups can reduce stigma and enhance engagement. Therapy should prioritize trust, patience, and respect for her collectivist, rural background, empowering Maria within her cultural values while gently supporting her autonomy and recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 06 - Multi-cultural issues\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 06 - Objective 1: What is cultural diversity, its relevance to Australia and to professional psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCulture is distinct from diversity, though often confused with it. While diversity includes variables like gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, and socioeconomic status, culture refers to shared behaviors, customs, values, and learned knowledge within a society. Multiculturalism emphasizes peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among different cultural groups. In psychology, culture shapes development, cognition, personality, psychopathology, and therapeutic needs. Concepts such as ethnocentrism (judging others by one’s cultural standards), cultural relativism (understanding behaviors in their own cultural context), and cultural universals (traits common across all cultures) help contextualize cultural impacts. The tripartite model further explains how individuals are influenced at the unique, group, and universal levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAustralia exemplifies cultural diversity, with around 40% of its population being immigrants or their children, and 15% speaking a language other than English at home. This diversity challenges the ethnocentric assumptions of Western psychology, which often overlooks cultural context by focusing on individualism and internal causes of mental illness. Professional psychologists are increasingly called to develop cultural competence, acknowledging that Western-based theories, diagnostic tools like the DSM-5, and therapies like CBT may not universally apply. Cross-cultural psychology underscores the importance of training psychologists to address cultural differences to ensure equitable and effective psychological care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 06 - Objective 2: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis presentation explores the cultural influences on the diagnosis and understanding of mental illness. It outlines four major theoretical causes of abnormal behaviour and highlights the limitations of using Western diagnostic systems, like the DSM-5, universally. While schizophrenia is biologically consistent across cultures (etic), its prevalence and outcomes vary significantly due to cultural and social factors (emic). WHO studies found better outcomes in developing nations, attributed to stronger community support and less reliance on medical models. Factors like individualism, access to healthcare, and stigma further influence how mental illnesses manifest and are treated globally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presentation critiques the DSM-5’s assumptions of universality, noting its ethnocentric bias. Although it attempts to incorporate cultural elements, such as through symptom limits and cultural notes, it still primarily reflects Western norms. The existence of culture-bound syndromes—mental disorders recognized only in specific cultures—challenges the idea that DSM categories are universal. Alternative systems, like China’s CCMD-3, demonstrate the value of emic approaches and support a more culturally inclusive model of mental health classification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 06 - Objective 3: What is migration stress and evaluate acculturation strategies to decrease stress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers have proposed five hypotheses to explain the high rates of schizophrenia among migrant groups, including refugees. The first hypothesis—that countries of origin have high schizophrenia rates—lacks evidence. The second suggests self-selection, where individuals predisposed to mental illness are more likely to migrate; this is only partially true. The third hypothesis claims migration stress causes schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals, but data shows the onset peaks 10–12 years post-migration, not immediately. The fourth posits that high rates are due to misdiagnosis by host clinicians, but most studies assess symptoms directly, not diagnoses. The fifth hypothesis, which is somewhat supported, argues that cultural incongruity and ethnic density lead to acculturative stress, learned helplessness, and increased mental illness, particularly among marginalized migrant communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnculturation refers to learning and internalizing one’s original cultural norms, often from childhood. Acculturation occurs when individuals migrate and begin adapting to a new national culture. Acculturation strategies influence mental health outcomes. \u003cem\u003eIntegration\u003c/em\u003e—accepting both original and host cultures—is linked to better support and access to services. In contrast, \u003cem\u003emarginalization\u003c/em\u003e—rejecting both cultures—is associated with poorer outcomes, including limited community support and reduced access to mental health care. Afghan refugees, for example, often report high levels of depression and anxiety, especially when they experience marginalization due to forced displacement and cultural disconnection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 06 - Objective 4: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis presentation compares two models of psychological intervention: the traditional welfare state model (etic) and the service provision model (emic). The welfare model applies standardized, cost-effective approaches across diverse populations, often ignoring cultural relevance. For example, a standardized parenting program in a Vietnamese community failed due to cultural mismatch, as concepts like parent training were unfamiliar and uncomfortable. The emic service model, in contrast, emphasizes cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, even if it is more resource-intensive, to ensure programs are beneficial to all communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also offers a comparative analysis of Western psychotherapies—Psychoanalysis, Humanistic, and CBT—and contrasts them with Naikan therapy, a Japanese collectivist approach. CBT, shaped by individualistic Western values, focuses on internal faults and rewards productivity, sometimes contributing to mental illness stigma. Naikan therapy emphasizes introspection, gratitude, and social interdependence, rooted in Buddhist and collectivist beliefs. It encourages self-reflection through structured questions and may offer unique therapeutic value, though its applicability across cultures and disorders remains debatable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 06 - Objective 5: What is cultural competence and explain its training and evaluation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCultural competence in psychotherapy involves four key skills: admission of limitations, self-awareness, cultural knowledge, and clinical application. For therapy to be effective, clients must perceive the therapist as culturally understanding, which strengthens the therapeutic relationship, encourages disclosure, and improves adherence to treatment. Therapists must recognize their limitations—highlighted by the Dunning-Kruger effect—since overestimating competence can alienate clients and reduce treatment success. Self-awareness is essential, requiring therapists to reflect on their own cultural values and biases shaped through enculturation. Tools like Bronfenbrenner's systems and Hofstede’s dimensions help psychologists understand their worldview and compare it to their clients', reducing ethnocentric judgments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCultural knowledge enables therapists to develop culturally appropriate skills in assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes adapting Western therapies and considering cultural or religious norms that affect therapy’s acceptability. Training programs must integrate multicultural content throughout all areas of psychology and evaluate cultural competence alongside clinical skills. Diverse student recruitment and culturally-informed teaching staff are also essential. Including multicultural or Indigenous placements ensures that graduates are prepared to provide competent and sensitive care in diverse settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 08 - Explaining stigma\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 08 - Objective 1: Explain the emerging conceptualization of human behaviour\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conceptualization of human behaviour began with categorizing people by traits like gender, age, and size—initially as neutral differences. As psychology developed, it introduced hypothetical constructs such as intelligence to better understand and assess behaviour. Alfred Binet pioneered intelligence testing to identify children needing special education, which evolved from binary categories into measurable continuums like the normal curve. Eventually, statistical deviations were culturally evaluated, with higher scores seen as desirable and lower scores as less desirable. This gave rise to labels like “idiot” or “moron,” which shifted over time to more neutral terms such as “intellectual disability” as public usage turned derogatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese labels, while intended to objectively describe behaviour, became attached to individuals, attracting stereotypes that influence how society treats them. For example, people with mental illness may be stereotyped as dangerous, leading to social avoidance, reduced employment opportunities, or institutionalization. Such responses, even when framed as help, often result in benevolent discrimination, reinforcing stigma and limiting inclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 08 - Objective 2: Discuss DSM 5 in terms of development, general issues raised during development and the issue of pathologizing normal behaviour\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSM, originally developed to classify and diagnose abnormal behaviour for targeted treatment, has evolved from hypothetical constructs to symptom-based criteria for greater reliability. However, its validity remains debated, especially under pressures from the anti-psychiatry movement and pharmaceutical influence. DSM-5 faces criticism for expanding diagnoses to pathologize normal behaviours, contributing to high prevalence rates of mental illness in the population. Moreover, it operates as an EMIC (US-based) system imposed globally (ETIC), and is seen more as a political document than a scientific one. Its reliance on clinical opinion, rather than empirical evidence, undermines individual and cultural differences, reinforcing a biased and often exclusionary framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCritiques highlight gender, socioeconomic, age, and LGBTI+ biases within the DSM. Females, the elderly, the poor, and sexual minorities often face misdiagnosis due to sociocultural prejudices codified as mental illness. These diagnostic practices favour a Western, male-dominated worldview, ignoring broader environmental or systemic factors. Ultimately, while the DSM offers clinical utility, it also reinforces stigmatization and marginalization, privileging pharmaceutical treatments and distancing therapists from clients’ lived realities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 08 - Objective 3: Theoretically explain how DSM labels help create stigma toward people with mental health problems\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, mental health professionals significantly contributed to the stigmatization of homosexuality by labeling it as a disorder. In the 1950s, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental illness, legitimizing discrimination. This label, lacking scientific evidence, harmed the emerging gay rights movement and justified harmful practices like conversion therapy. The APA’s eventual removal of this classification, followed by the World Health Organization’s 1990 decision to eliminate homosexuality from the ICD, marked a shift away from medicalized discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, progress has been made in repealing sodomy laws, securing workplace protections, enabling military service, marriage equality, and adoption rights for LGBTI+ people. The mental health field also shifted its focus toward understanding the needs of LGBTI+ individuals, recognizing that social stigma, not homosexuality, contributes to mental health risks. Research shows that ongoing discrimination leads to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders among lesbians and gay males, reflecting the enduring impact of stigma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 08 - Objective 4: Explain public and self-stigma and discuss strategies for changing stigma\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis presentation explores the impact of stigma on individuals with mental illness, distinguishing between \u003cstrong\u003epublic stigma\u003c/strong\u003e - society’s negative perceptions—and \u003cstrong\u003eself-stigma\u003c/strong\u003e, where individuals internalize these attitudes. Public stigma is built on stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, leading to social avoidance, job and housing exclusion, and coercive treatment. Self-stigma can result in low self-esteem, depression, and learned helplessness, although some individuals respond with righteous anger, using stigma as motivation to advocate for better services and equality. Cultural examples, like the treatment of albinism in some societies, highlight how arbitrary and harmful stigmas can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo combat public stigma, four main strategies are discussed: \u003cstrong\u003eprotest\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eeducation\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003econtact\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eintegration\u003c/strong\u003e. Protest challenges harmful portrayals but doesn’t change attitudes. Education helps reduce stigma through factual understanding. Contact with individuals who have mental illness helps humanize and reduce fear. Integration, involving collaborative efforts between patients, families, and professionals, fosters inclusion but remains limited due to systemic segregation in health systems. Alternative models—\u003cstrong\u003emedicalization\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003enormalization\u003c/strong\u003e—offer competing ways to reduce stigma through redefining or removing psychiatric labels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 08 - Objective 5: Discuss the future role of psychology in the area of stigma\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost stigma research tends to focus on individual psychological factors—such as gender or literacy—particularly in the context of help-seeking behavior. This approach can unintentionally reinforce a “blame the victim” narrative and promote clinical interventions aimed solely at the individual. However, stigma is not just a personal issue; it is deeply embedded within the broader social structures that shape society, such as laws, social services, and the justice system. These structures influence how resources are distributed and often perpetuate systemic disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address stigma effectively, research and interventions must shift toward examining and transforming these underlying social structures. Key challenges include evaluating the cost-benefit of labeling mental illness, understanding the risks of pathologizing normal behavior, and confronting the cultural norm in Western societies of avoiding discomfort—both physical and psychological. Moreover, the widespread use of medication to manage symptoms without tackling root causes contributes to the problem. A major priority is to develop and implement strategies that reduce stigma at both individual and societal levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 09 - Big issues/Wicked problems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 09 - Objective 1: Identifying and tackling big issues\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePsychology has traditionally defined itself as the science of human behaviour, focusing largely on the individual. From its early emphasis on the brain, information processing, and personality, psychology reinforced internal, universal explanations for behaviour while sidelining environmental and societal influences. As an applied field, it shifted from philosophical inquiry to assessments and diagnosis, especially from the 1920s onward. However, psychological interventions, dominated by medical models and personality theories, continued to treat symptoms rather than causes. With limited success, the field often stigmatized individuals as abnormal without addressing broader societal problems. Despite pivotal social experiments in the 1960s and 70s, psychology has lacked a comprehensive bio-psychosocial theory and remained mostly silent on major social issues like poverty and domestic violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic violence is a complex, multifaceted form of abuse occurring in both heterosexual and same-sex relationships, often involving physical, emotional, economic, or sexual harm. Women are disproportionately the victims, while men are typically the perpetrators. Root causes include patriarchal social structures, intergenerational abuse, drug and alcohol use, gender roles, and failures in the criminal justice system. Psychology often misattributes the issue to individual pathology, such as personality disorders or victim weakness, rather than confronting systemic inequalities. As a \"wicked problem,\" domestic violence resists simple solutions—many interventions may have limited impact or unintended consequences unless they also target the broader societal and political structures that sustain gender inequality and power imbalances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 09 - Objective 2: What is a wicked problem: definition and parameters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWicked problems are complex, socially embedded issues that are difficult or impossible to solve definitively. Coined by Rittel and Webber, the concept highlights that these problems have many causes and interdependencies—solving one part can reveal or create new problems. Wicked problems lack a clear definition, have no stopping point, and require more than scientific methods; they involve social policy, changing constraints, and conflicting stakeholder views in a pluralistic society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to tame problems—which are clearly defined, linear, and solvable through expert-driven analysis—wicked problems are dynamic and resist simple solutions. Their framing depends on the proposed solution, and outcomes are unpredictable or subjective. Psychology, traditionally successful with tame problems, struggles with wicked ones due to their applied, community-based nature, lack of objective variables, and the need for creative, interdisciplinary approaches. Addressing wicked problems requires ongoing collaboration, flexible thinking, and acknowledgment of competing values and interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 09 - Objective 3: Using the example of \"Domestic violence“, explain the 10 characteristics of a wicked problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo definitive formulation: Domestic violence lacks a single definition—psychologists, sociologists, and legal experts each frame it differently based on their worldview.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo stopping rule: There’s no clear point at which domestic violence is “solved”; efforts often stop due to limits in time or resources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolutions are better or worse, not true or false: Responses are judged by varying standards across disciplines, not by objective correctness.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo ultimate test: Effects of interventions (e.g., tougher laws) may take years to show, and unintended consequences may surface later.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne-shot operation: Each policy has lasting impact—trial-and-error is too risky when human lives are involved.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo full list of solutions: Not all causes or interventions are known; solutions must be flexible and evolving.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach is essentially unique: Domestic violence shares features with other problems but also presents unique sociocultural challenges.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSymptom of another problem: It reflects broader issues like gender inequality or cultural norms.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplanations determine solutions: How the problem is framed influences proposed interventions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo right to be wrong: Practitioners and policymakers are accountable for outcomes—ethical caution is crucial.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 09 - Objective 4: What is a mind map: definition and creation of mind maps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mind map is a visual tool used to organize information hierarchically, highlighting the relationships between different ideas. It typically begins with a central concept—such as gender inequality—and branches into related ideas, like male gender toxicity, and more distal examples, such as domestic violence. Mind maps are useful for generating, linking, and classifying ideas, and are commonly used for tasks like essay writing, decision-making, and course planning. They are also valuable in addressing “tame” problems and brainstorming “wicked” problems, where multiple stakeholders contribute individual mind maps that are later integrated to explore complex solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch on undergraduate students shows that mind maps significantly improve understanding and memory recall compared to traditional methods like reading or attending lectures. They help students engage more deeply with material and organize concepts more effectively. Interestingly, mind maps may be especially helpful for low-ability students who benefit from the visual structure, while high-ability students may already mentally visualize these connections without needing a physical map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 09 - Objective 5: Explain the three major strategies to progress the resolution of wicked problems\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWicked problems are complex and lack clear definitions, making them unsuitable for traditional, step-by-step problem-solving methods. Instead, they require flexible approaches that can adapt to evolving challenges and multiple perspectives. Each strategy has trade-offs depending on the context of the wicked problem. Three main strategies are used to tackle wicked problems: authoritative, competitive, and collaborative. These aim to manage, not necessarily solve, the issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe authoritative strategy places control in the hands of a few experts, reducing complexity by limiting stakeholder involvement. However, this can overlook important perspectives. An example is the Northern Territory Intervention, where top-down policies were applied to Indigenous communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe competitive strategy pits groups against each other to generate solutions, encouraging variety but risking conflict and poor cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collaborative strategy involves all stakeholders in finding a shared solution, improving commitment and implementation. Yet, it is time-consuming and vulnerable to failure, especially with inconsistent government support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 10 - Future challenges in professional psychology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 10 - Objective 1: Discuss the importance of context in clinical psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 10 - Objective 2: Discuss ethical and legal issues in clinical psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 10 - Objective 3: Discuss digital issues and Tele-health in clinical psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 10 - Objective 4: Discuss clinical and private practice issues in psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 10 - Objective 5: Future trends in Clinical Psychology and Psychology in Australia\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 11 - Life after third year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 11 - Objective 1: Explain the historical and current pathways within Australian psychology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 11 - Objective 2: Honours degree in psychology: process; structure; preparation; application process and strategy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 11 - Objective 3: Ph.D. option: entry qualifications, minimum expectations, motivation to complete and challenge to complete [attrition rate]\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 11 - Objective 4: Understand the different postgraduate (Masters) psychology options and identify the different specialty areas of practice that a psychologist can be endorsed in\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek 11 - Objective 5: Consider non-psychology employment options for psychology graduates\u003c/h3\u003e\n"},"relatedPosts":[{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/2025/sem-a/professional-practices-and-cross-cultural-psychology/midterm-2","title":"Professional Practices and Cross Cultural Psychology - Midterm 2","date":"2025-05-22"},{"id":"education/universities","title":"Universities","date":"2025-05-19"},{"id":"education/degrees","title":"Academic Degrees","date":"2025-05-03"},{"id":"education/prizes","title":"Academic Prizes","date":"2025-05-03"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/books","title":"Books","date":"2025-05-01"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/curriculum","title":"Curriculum","date":"2025-05-01"},{"id":"education/social/economics","title":"Economics","date":"2025-05-01"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/master","title":"Master in Psychology","date":"2025-05-01"},{"id":"education/online","title":"Online Education","date":"2025-05-01"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[...id]","query":{"id":["education","social","psychology","rmit","2025","sem-a","professional-practices-and-cross-cultural-psychology","midterm-2"]},"buildId":"GvpGi1b3pswtHiNT7FisS","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

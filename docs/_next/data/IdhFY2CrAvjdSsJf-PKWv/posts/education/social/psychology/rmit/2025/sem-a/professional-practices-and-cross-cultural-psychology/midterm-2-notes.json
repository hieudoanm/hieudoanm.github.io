Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Psychotherapy visit</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Relevant client background/history</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.</p>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clinical diagnosis</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).</li>\n<li>High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural Context and Migration Stressors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.</li>\n<li>A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Week 06 -

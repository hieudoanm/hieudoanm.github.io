Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Psychotherapy visit</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Relevant client background/history</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.</p>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clinical diagnosis</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).</li>\n<li>High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural Context and Migration Stressors</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.</li>\n<li>A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Week 06 - Multi-cultural issues</h2>\n<h3>Week 06 - Objective 1: What is cultural diversity, its relevance to Australia and to professional psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 06 - Objective 2: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity</h3>\n<h3>Week 06 - Objective 3: What is migration stress and evaluate acculturation strategies to decrease stress</h3>\n<h3>Week 06 - Objective 4: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society</h3>\n<h3>Week 06 - Objective 5: What is cultural competence and explain its training and evaluation</h3>\n<h2>Week 08 - Explaining stigma</h2>\n<h3>Week 08 - Objective 1: Explain the emerging conceptualization of human behaviour</h3>\n<h3>Week 08 - Objective 2: Discuss DSM 5 in terms of development, general issues raised during development and the issue of pathologizing normal behaviour</h3>\n<h3>Week 08 - Objective 3: Theoretically explain how DSM labels help create stigma toward people with mental health problems</h3>\n<h3>Week 08 - Objective 4: Explain public and self-stigma and discuss strategies for changing stigma</h3>\n<h3>Week 08 - Objective 5: Discuss the future role of psychology in the area of stigma</h3>\n<h2>Week 09 - Big issues/Wicked problems</h2>\n<h3>Week 09 - Objective 1: Identifying and tackling big issues</h3>\n<h3>Week 09 - Objective 2: What is a wicked problem: definition and parameters</h3>\n<h3>Week 09 - Objective 3: Using the example of \"Domestic violence“, explain the 10 characteristics of a wicked problem</h3>\n<h3>Week 09 - Objective 4: What is a mind map: definition and creation of mind maps</h3>\n<h3>Week 09 - Objective 5: Explain the three major strategies to progress the resolution of wicked problems</h3>\n<h2>Week 10 - Future challenges in professional psychology</h2>\n<h3>Week 10 - Objective 1: Discuss the importance of context in clinical psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 10 - Objective 2: Discuss ethical and legal issues in clinical psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 10 - Objective 3: Discuss digital issues and Tele-health in clinical psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 10 - Objective 4: Discuss clinical and private practice issues in psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 10 - Objective 5: Future trends in Clinical Psychology and Psychology in Australia</h3>\n<h2>Week 11 - Life after third year</h2>\n<h3>Week 11 - Objective 1: Explain the historical and current pathways within Australian psychology</h3>\n<h3>Week 11 - Objective 2: Honours degree in psychology: process;

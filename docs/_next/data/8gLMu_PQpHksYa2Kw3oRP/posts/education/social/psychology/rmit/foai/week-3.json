How do we turn raw information into useful insights or actions? That’s where data science comes in.\n<ul>\n<li>Data science combines maths and statistics, specialised programming, AI and machine learning to uncover insights hidden in an organisation's data. [IBM]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In short, data science is about extracting insights and knowledge from data.\n<ul>\n<li>We have learned from last week that powerful AI systems like deep learning needs a lot of data and computing power. That's when data science comes in - to help manage and make sense of the massive (unstructured) datasets needed to train these systems.</li>\n<li>Datasets\n<ul>\n<li>MNIST\n<ul>\n<li>70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each 28x28 pixels.</li>\n<li>Used for: Digit recognition and basic image classification tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>CIFAR-10\n<ul>\n<li>A dataset of 60,000 small (32x32) colour images across 10 categories (e.g., aeroplane, dog, truck).</li>\n<li>Used for: Image classification, object recognition, image retrieval, segmentation tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>CheXpert\n<ul>\n<li>A large dataset of chest X-rays and associated reports from Stanford Medicine (over 200,000 images).</li>\n<li>Used for: Medical AI development, especially for detecting lung and heart conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Waymo dataset\n<ul>\n<li>High-resolution data collected from autonomous vehicles, including LiDAR, camera footage, and maps</li>\n<li>Used for: Self-driving car research — object detection, motion prediction, lane tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Review and Reflect</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Woebot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to support mental health through conversation, making it a real-world example of AI used in healthcare and therapy.</li>\n<li>Philosophy helps us think about ethics, consciousness, and the societal impact of AI—especially when imagining long-term futures.</li>\n<li>A text corpus is the standard term in AI and linguistics for a large, structured set of text data used for analysis or training models.</li>\n<li>Object recognition is a fundamental computer vision task where AI identifies and labels objects within images.</li>\n<li>.csv (comma-separated values) is a widely used file format for storing structured tabular data, especially in data science and machine learning.</li>\n</ul>\n"},"relatedPosts":[{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/foai/week-1","title":"FoAI - Week 1","date":"2025-06-30"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/foai/week-2","title":"FoAI - Week 2","date":"2025-06-30"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/foai/week-3","title":"FoAI - Week 3","date":"2025-06-30"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/rmit/foai/week-4","title":"FoAI - Week 4","date":"2025-06-30"},{"id":"education/universities","title":"Universities","date":"2025-05-19"},{"id":"education/degrees","title":"Academic Degrees","date":"2025-05-03"},{"id":"education/social/psychology/master","title":"Master in Psychology","date":"2025-05-01"},{"id":"education/online","title":"Online Education","date":"2025-05-01"}]},"__N_SSG":true}

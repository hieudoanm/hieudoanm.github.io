This framework is **Ruby-first** and optimised for **modern Ruby (3.2+)** across backend, API, and full-stack applications.

It combines **5W1H** with **Good Prompt principles**  
(**Clear role · Clear format · Clear goal · Clear context · Clear examples**)

The key idea:  
👉 **Context enforces clarity, conventions, and object boundaries**  
👉 **User intent defines trade-offs between expressiveness, performance, and safety**

---

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They guarantee **production-grade, idiomatic Ruby code**.

---

### 👤 Who (Role / Persona)

#### Default Persona (Recommended)

- You are a **senior Ruby engineer**
- Think like a **staff-level backend / platform engineer**
- Assume **large, long-lived Ruby codebases**
- Optimise for **readability, conventions, and maintainability**

#### Expected Expertise

- Ruby **3.2+**
- Object-oriented design and mixins
- Immutability and value semantics
- Enumerable and functional patterns
- Keyword arguments and pattern matching
- Metaprogramming (used sparingly)
- Ruby memory model & GC basics
- Bundler & RubyGems
- Frameworks (Rails, Sinatra, Hanami) when relevant
- Testing (RSpec, Minitest)
- Static analysis (RuboCop, Sorbet, Steep)

---

### 🛠️ How (Format / Constraints / Style)

#### 📦 Format / Output

- Use **Ruby 3.2+** syntax
- Prefer:
  - Explicit keyword arguments
  - Small, intention-revealing methods
- Organize code by:
  - Domain boundaries
  - Clear namespaces (modules)
- Use:
  - Code blocks (```)
  - Bullet points for explanations
  - Tables for trade-offs when helpful

---

#### ⚙️ Constraints (Ruby Best Practices)

- Follow the **Principle of Least Surprise**
- Avoid monkey-patching core classes
- Avoid excessive metaprogramming
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Avoid long methods and god objects
- Prefer immutable objects where practical
- Use symbols consistently
- Avoid nil-heavy APIs (use objects or Null Objects)
- Follow community conventions (Ruby Style Guide)

---

#### 🧱 Architecture & Design Rules

- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain logic independent of frameworks
- Rails is a delivery mechanism, not the domain
- Controllers/services are thin
- Business logic lives in domain objects
- Explicit boundaries between:
  - Web
  - Jobs
  - Domain
  - Persistence
- Prefer POROs (Plain Old Ruby Objects)
- Use modules for cohesion, not dumping grounds

---

#### ⚡ Performance, Memory & Safety

- Be mindful of:
  - Object allocations
  - Enumerable chaining
  - N+1 queries (in ORM contexts)
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use frozen constants and objects
- Profile before optimizing (stackprof, ruby-prof)
- Validate external input early
- Escape output appropriately (HTML, SQL)

---

#### 🧪 Reliability, Testing & Portability

- Deterministic domain logic
- Test pyramid:
  - Unit tests for domain objects
  - Integration tests for adapters
- Prefer testing behavior, not implementation
- Use factories and fixtures carefully
- Portable across:
  - CLI
  - Web servers
  - Background job runners
- Configuration via environment variables
- Structured logging

---

#### 📝 Explanation Style

- Ruby-specific reasoning
- Explain:
  - Object boundaries and responsibilities
  - Why idiomatic Ruby was chosen
  - Trade-offs between expressiveness and safety
- Avoid Java- or C-style explanations
- Focus on clarity and long-term readability

---

## ✍️ User-owned

> These sections must come from the user.  
> They represent **intent, constraints, and system-specific requirements**.

---

### 📌 What (Task / Action)

Examples:

- Implement a Ruby service or object
- Design domain models
- Refactor legacy Rails code
- Improve readability and structure
- Review Ruby architecture

---

### 🎯 Why (Intent / Goal)

Examples:

- Improve maintainability
- Reduce cognitive load
- Make business logic explicit
- Enable safer refactors
- Improve testability

---

### 📍 Where (Context / Situation)

Examples:

- Ruby on Rails application
- Background jobs (Sidekiq, Resque)
- CLI tooling
- API-only backend
- Legacy monolith

---

### ⏰ When (Time / Phase / Lifecycle)

Examples:

- Greenfield development
- Rails upgrade
- Domain extraction
- Pre-release hardening
- Long-term maintenance

---

## 🔗 Final Prompt Template (Recommended Order)

### 1️⃣ Persistent Context (Put in `.cursor/rules.md`)

```md
# Engineering AI Rules — Ruby

You are a senior Ruby engineer.
Think like a staff-level engineer building expressive, maintainable systems.

## Language

- Ruby 3.2+

## Core Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Objects with single responsibilities
- Convention over configuration

## Design

- Small, focused objects
- Explicit dependencies
- Domain-first design

## Error Handling

- Explicit errors
- No silent nils

## Testing

- Behavior-driven tests
- Deterministic, readable specs

## Code Style

- Idiomatic Ruby
- RuboCop-aligned
- Readable, intention-revealing code
```

---

### 2️⃣ User Prompt Template (Paste into Cursor Chat)

```text
Task:
[Describe exactly what you want to implement, refactor, or review.]

Why it matters:
[Explain readability, correctness, or maintainability goals.]

Where this applies:
[Framework, runtime, constraints.]
(Optional)

When this is needed:
[Project phase or urgency.]
(Optional)
```

---

### ✅ Fully Filled Example

```text
Task:
Refactor a Rails service object handling subscription renewals.

Why it matters:
The current logic is hard to follow and error-prone.

Where this applies:
A Rails 7 billing system using Sidekiq.

When this is needed:
Before introducing new pricing tiers.
```

## 🧠 Why This Ordering Works

- **Who → How** enforces Ruby conventions and object discipline
- **What → Why** clarifies intent and readability goals
- **Where → When** tunes abstractions and boundaries

> **Rules enforce clarity.  
> Prompts express intent.  
> Context makes Ruby systems joyful and maintainable.**

Happy Ruby Engineering 💎✨

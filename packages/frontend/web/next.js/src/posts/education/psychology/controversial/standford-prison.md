## Intro

The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE), conducted in 1971 by psychologist Philip Zimbardo.

## Issues

### Methodology

- Lack of Scientific Rigor: lacked clear operational definitions and standardized procedures.
- Zimbardo himself acted as the prison superintendent, blurring the line between observer and participant, compromising objectivity.
- Demand Characteristics: Both "prisoners" and "guards" was given instruction of how to behave, so the action and its consequence was not genuine.
- Small and Unrepresentative Sample: Only a group of 24 colleges students (mostly white and middle-class)

### Ethical

- Lack of Informed Consent: The participants are not informed of potential psychological distress.
- Lack of Protection of Participants from Psychological Harm: Some participants (mostly plays prisoners) experience emotional and psychological distress
- Lack of Right to Withdraw: Participants are not allowed to leave
- Dual Roles and Conflict of Interest: Zimbardo act as both observer and superintendent, influecing the research himself

### Generalization and Validity

- Failed to Generalization anything due to difficulty in Reproducing
- Scripted and Instructed Behavior

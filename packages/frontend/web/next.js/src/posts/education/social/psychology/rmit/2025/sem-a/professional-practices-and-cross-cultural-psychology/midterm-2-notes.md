## Case Study

### Details

Suggest a culturally-appropriate treatment strategy for the following case study

> The Patient

Maria, a 30-year-old female; is a [strict] Roman Catholic; has migrated from a rural region of Peru [South America] just over a year ago; is married; and, the parent of two school-age children. Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..

> Psychotherapy visit

In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.

> Relevant client background/history

The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.

### Analysis

> Clinical diagnosis

- Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).
- High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).

> Cultural Context and Migration Stressors

- A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.
- A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).

## Week 06 - Multi-cultural issues

### Week 06 - Objective 1: What is cultural diversity, its relevance to Australia and to professional psychology

### Week 06 - Objective 2: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity

### Week 06 - Objective 3: What is migration stress and evaluate acculturation strategies to decrease stress

### Week 06 - Objective 4: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society

### Week 06 - Objective 5: What is cultural competence and explain its training and evaluation

## Week 08 - Explaining stigma

### Week 08 - Objective 1: Explain the emerging conceptualization of human behaviour

### Week 08 - Objective 2: Discuss DSM 5 in terms of development, general issues raised during development and the issue of pathologizing normal behaviour

### Week 08 - Objective 3: Theoretically explain how DSM labels help create stigma toward people with mental health problems

### Week 08 - Objective 4: Explain public and self-stigma and discuss strategies for changing stigma

### Week 08 - Objective 5: Discuss the future role of psychology in the area of stigma

- Social Structures
  - Most research that examines stigma focuses on the impact at the individual psychological level – this reinforces the idea of “blaming the victim” and focuses on individual clinical intervention – for example, understanding individual factors in help-seeking behaviour [gender, literacy etc]
  - For the most part, studies have ignored the fact that stigma is inherent in the social structures that make up society.
  - Stigma is evident in the way laws, social services, and the justice system are structured as well as ways in which resources are allocated.
  - Research and interventions that focuses on the social structures that maintain stigma and strategies for changing them are required.
- Challenges include:
  - Determine the cost-benefit analysis of labelling mental illness
  - Determine the impact/problem of pathologizing the normal
  - Problem with modern Western societies seeking pleasure and avoiding both physical and psychological pain
  - Chronic use of medication [both physical and mental health] to treat symptoms [and not the cure problems]
  - Identifying an effective strategy to remove stigma from society

## Week 09 - Big issues/Wicked problems

### Week 09 - Objective 1: Identifying and tackling big issues

- Psychology as a [pure] discipline
  - Has defined itself as the science of human behaviour
  - Assumed that the focus of behaviour would be at the individual level
  - The original areas of study
    - Human brain
    - Human information processing
    - Human genome
    - Human personality
  - Reinforced the focus on the internal determinants of an individual’s behaviour
  - Lead to the assumptions of universality of traits and the over-reliance of quantitative methodology and ETIC research
  - Ignore the saying "No Man is an Island"
- Psychology as an [applied] discipline
  - Pre-1920s
    - Focused on explaining philosophical issues
    - Focused on theory and explanation
  - 1920s
    - added the development and evaluation of psychological assessments
    - Began with intelligence testing, but then to selection and then all individual differences [personality, motivation, skills, etc]
  - 1950s
    - Psychopathology – development of DSM classification systems – but not intervention, just psych assessment and description
  - Continue to focus on normal vs abnormal individual and ignore the role of environment
  - 1960s
    - While still supporting the medical profession [Behavioural medicine] began to develop interventions
    - Interventions however were developed by
      - Personality psychologists – applying theory of the normal to the abnormal
      - Focused on individual behavioural [and then cognitive] change
      - Psychological assessments that determined the abnormal and could measure successful change
    - Interventions were
      - Consistent with the philosophy of focussing on individuals
      - Consistent with the philosophy of universalism
      - Were located in clinics and therefore ignored the environment
      - Plagued by dominance of medical profession [biology over cognitions]
      - Low success rates: high attrition rates, low adherence, high relapse [see second year Applied Social Psychology]
      - Treating the symptoms and not the cause
    - Consequences
      - Medicine and the medical model continue to dominate
      - Psychology continued to focus on the individual
      - Society’s physical and mental health problems persisted [and in many cases got worse] – especially depression and suicide
      - Psychology with its individual focus
        - psycho-pathologised the patient [they were abnormal-not society]
        - blaming the victim – created mental health stigma
  - 1960s – 1970s
    - Social psychological research began – but not with major explanations of human behaviour – but with remarkable experiments
    - Asch conformity
    - Milgram obedience
    - Zimbardo power of environment

## Case Study

### Details

Suggest a culturally-appropriate treatment strategy for the following case study

> The Patient

Maria, a 30-year-old female; is a [strict] Roman Catholic; has migrated from a rural region of Peru [South America] just over a year ago; is married; and, the parent of two school-age children. Two months prior to the referral to the psychologist, she had been seeking treatment from her medical practitioner [Dr G.] for tiredness, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances. Dr G. prescribed a sedating anti-depressant (SSRIs). A month ago, Maria was hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She had taken an overdose of sleeping medication. As a consequence, Dr G referred Maria to psychologist Dr C..

> Psychotherapy visit

In her first session, Maria was low-keyed, restrained in behaviour, avoided eye contact, and found it difficult to verbalize her thoughts and feelings. Additionally, Dr C. noted that Maria exhibited extreme helplessness and hopelessness.

> Relevant client background/history

The suicide attempt occurred after Maria’s husband, Esteban, her high school sweetheart, refused to allow her to attend night school. Maria had registered for night school; signed up for a course; and had even bought her books. In response, Esteban had gone into a rage, tearing up her registration papers and destroying her books. He refused to go to therapy with Maria.

### Analysis

> Clinical diagnosis

- Symptoms of major depressive disorder: tiredness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, hopelessness, helplessness, and significant withdrawal (e.g., avoiding eye contact, restrained behavior).
- High suicide risk: evidenced by a recent suicide attempt (intentional overdose).

> Cultural Context and Migration Stressors

- A recent immigrant from rural Peru, likely experiencing acculturative stress and disruption of social support.
- A strict Roman Catholic, which might influence her views on marriage, obedience, duty, and suicide (e.g., shame, guilt, spiritual conflict).

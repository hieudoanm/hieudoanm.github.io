#### Week 03 - Learning Objective 04: Discuss research using the factor analysis to study Worldviews and its ability to predict responses on fundamental traits of human nature

- Research
  - Nilsson, A. (2015) on Worldview factors:
    - Factors
      - Worldview factor 1: Scientism-reductionism = "There is a rational explanation of everything"
      - Worldview factor 2: Scientism-common sense empiricism = "All knowledge is based on experience and observation, theories are by themselves meaningless abstraction"
      - Worldview factor 3: Scientific naturalism = "Human action is constrained by the limits placed by inheritance and environment"
      - Worldview factor 4: Common sense empiricism = "You should be critical and ready to challenge authorities as everyone else"
    - Limitaion: Sample only colleges students
  - Saucier, G., et al (2015): Global [pan-cultural] focus and therefore minimal focus on national [cross cultural] issues and the individual [psychological] level
  - Bond, M., et al. (2004)
    - Dynamic externality – scored high on religiousity, reward for application, fate control
    - Societal cynicism – living in a predictable, benign environment, do not aspire to high performance but focus on sensible, realistic, achievable outcomes
    - Dynamic externality vs Societal cynicism => create 4 group of people

|                          | Dynamic externality - Low | Dynamic externality - High |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Societal cynicism - High | Germany and Japan         | Russia and Hong Kong       |
| Societal cynicism - Low  | USA and Australia         | Philippines and Indonesia  |

- Factors
  - Factor 1: Religiosity – This factor focuses on religious authority and tradition. People scoring high on this factor believe in the existence of a God who created nature and life and controls what happens to people – both good and bad
  - Factor 2: Naturalism - This factor is associated with the relationship between humans and nature. This includes connectedness, choice of life style and [negative] impact of human activity on nature
  - Factor 3: Integrated Worldview - The third factor focuses on a global perspective. People scoring high on this factor feel connected to the universe, feel they are citizens of the world and see understanding their personal growth and knowledge from the sciences and the arts
  - Factor 4: Individualism - This factor is associated with being independent, using their own judgement, choosing their own life style and being recognized for their own achievements
  - Factor 5: Gestalt Formation - This cognitive factor emphasizes completeness/wholeness. That is, the idea that people should integrate all perspectives, appreciate and accept different perspectives from diverse groups, and is contrary to the belief that people should be defined by their own attributes
  - Factor 6: Scientism - This factor focuses on the belief that science is the ultimate source of facts [reality], that science is important and will ultimately solve all the world’s problems.
  - Factor 7: Developing self - This factor reflects that a fundamental part of developing is a welfare state and educational institutions that will lead to inner [personal] growth and self-actualization. If is contrary to individuals trying to adapt their self to fit into society

#### Week 03 - Learning Objective 05: Explain how profiling worldviews help understand how people act in various scenarios

- Factor 1: Religiosity - People with religious beliefs have a tendency to see humans as morally fragile and in need of guidance/direction by higher power
  - Increase Penalties: High
  - Change social values: Mid to Low
  - Rehabilitate: Low
- Factor 2: Naturalism - Strongly endorsing changing the society [which in turn will indirectly change the individual] and changing [rehabilitate] prisoners to strengthen their connection with society [develop skills to get jobs, money, home, family, etc]
  - Increase Penalties: Low
  - Change social values: High
  - Rehabilitate: High
- Factor 3: Integrated Worldview - Hence, the strong support for changing society and rehabilitation of prisoners.
  - Increase Penalties: Low
  - Change social values: High
  - Rehabilitate: Mid to High
- Factor 4: Individualism - From an individualistic perspective the most logically interventions are advocating harsher penalties for in the individual prisoner or rehabilitation of the prisoner – teaching the individual more appropriate life skills. Someone focusing on individualism is unlikely to endorse changing society to fit the individual
  - Increase Penalties: High
  - Change social values: Low
  - Rehabilitate: Mid
- Factor 5: Gestalt formation - Contrary to this prediction, the most favoured solution by this group was the simple judicial solution of increasing criminal penalties
  - Increase Penalties: High
  - Change social values: Low
  - Rehabilitate: Mid
- Factor 6: Scientism - In this case, the evidence suggests that the most pragmatic solution is to rehabilitate prisoners followed by changing societal values. Few people who believe in scientism would endorse the “failed” strategy of simply making penalties more harsh
  - Increase Penalties: Low
  - Change social values: Mid
  - Rehabilitate: High
- Factor 7: Hence a strong endorsement for this factor would not endorse changing society, but would focus on punishment [increase penalties] and individual skill development [rehabilitate prisoners]
  - Increase Penalties: High
  - Change social values: Low
  - Rehabilitate: High

- Definition: the recording and analysis of a person's psychological and behavioural characteristics, so as to assess or predict their capabilities in a certain sphere or to assist in identifying categories of people
- Offender profiling:
  - One of many criminal investigative tools
  - Is a scientific [educated] attempt at offender identification
  - Infers behaviours arising from a crime scene
  - From these behaviours – determines offender characteristics
  - Characteristics typically include
    - demographics [gender, age, education level, marital status, culture/ethnicity]
    - psychographics [personality traits and any psychopathology]
  - Primary goal is to allow investigators to identify a specific offender from the general population [hence demographics to arrest, psychographics when questioning]
- Errors:
  - Type 1 Error: Focus on the wrong suspect
  - Type 2 Error: Offender is ignored
- Most accurate profiling method
  - Behavioural Evidence Analysis – deductive reasoning – focuses on the scientific investigation via the collection, interpretation and testing of crime scene evidence
  - Equivocal forensic analysis – examine all crime scene evidence
  - Victimology – determine victim life-style [demographics, family and social history/background] – a forensic autopsy
  - Crime scene characteristics – mainly focus on victim’s relationships with location and known associates
  - Characteristics of crime and criminal behaviour/skill

  - The right to psychotherapy in the least restrictive environment
  - The right to exercise informed consent to treatment alternatives
  - The right to treatment that satisfies the highest standards of care
  - The right to expect that their therapist will act ethically
- Malpractice laws serve three important community functions:
  - It protects the public from professional wrongdoing by providing aversive consequences [professional, financial, personal] for misconduct
  - It transfers the “loss” from one party to another party who is more culpable
  - It distributes the cost of professional negligence across the profession through increased insurance premiums – hence put pressure on professional associations [APS] to self-regulate and self-scrutinize
- Proving malpractice [via the criminal justice system]:

  - Cultural universals: use the common global standard
    - ETIC – what all cultures have in common
    - EMIC – what is specific to each culture
- Tripartite model:
  - Individual level – genetics and non-shared experiences – all individuals are unique and are not like other individuals [solely EMIC influences]

  - Universal level – all individuals are, in some respects, like all other individuals [across cultures] [solely ETIC influences]
- Australia
  - Diverse Culture due to Immigrants and Refugees
- Issues
  - Western psychology makes universal assumptions

  - If cause is assumed to be biological, then the intervention [treatment] should logically be biological

#### Week 06 - Learning Object 02: Explain causation from a multicultural perspective and discuss the role of the DSM 5 in terms of cultural diversity

- There are four major causal explanations for abnormal behaviour
  - Supernatural healing: Evil Spirit
  - Natural healing: Imbalance/disharmony with the natural forces that rule the universe
  - Medical – physiological approaches: Weakness of exhaustion of nervous system of physiological imbalance
  - Social – Psychological: Emotional (or anxiety based) and/or cognitions
- Schizophrenia was universal [biological] but ETIC [causes] and EMIC [solutions]
  - Developing nations [eg India, Columbia, Nigeria] had better long-term outcomes [lower prevalence rates] compared to developed nations [eg, USA, UK, Denmark, Japan, Russia]
  - Constract to common logic because developed nation should have better conditions
  - Because developing nations is
    - not dominated by treatment via the medical disease model
    - focused on environmental areas
    - different social psychological influences
- DSM is extremly Western-influence and based on medical disease model

- Enculturation & Acculturation
  - Enculturation is the process whereby humans learn the cultural norms and behaviours of their (first) and original culture [see parenting and child development]
  - Acculturation begins to occur when humans migrate to a new national culture and begin to permanently reside within this new (host) culture. Humans in this context can choose to adapt to this new culture.

|                    | High Enculturation                 | Low Enculturation                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| High Acculturation | Integration (Low in Mental Health) | Assimilation                            |
| Low Acculturation  | Separation                         | Marginalisation (High in Mental Health) |

#### Week 06 - Learning Object 04: Discuss the impact of different service models and psychotherapies in a multicultural society

- Approarches

## Tactics

Here’s a list of the key chess tactics from the [article](https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-tactics#attackingf7f2), with short descriptions:

1. **Fork** – A single piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time.
2. **Pin** – A piece is unable to move because doing so would expose a more valuable piece behind it.
3. **Skewer** – Like a pin, but the more valuable piece is in front and must move, exposing a weaker piece.
4. **Discovered Attack** – Moving one piece reveals an attack from another piece behind it.
5. **Discovered Check** – A discovered attack where the revealed attack puts the opponent's king in check.
6. **Double Check** – A special type of discovered check where both the moving piece and the revealed piece check the king.
7. **Zwischenzug (Intermediate Move)** – Playing an unexpected move, like a check or capture, before executing an expected sequence.
8. **Deflection** – Luring an opponent's piece away from a key square or duty.
9. **Decoy** – Forcing an opponent’s piece onto a specific, usually bad, square.
10. **Overloading** – Forcing an opponent's piece to defend too many threats at once.
11. **Trapped Piece** – A piece that has no safe moves and is at risk of capture.
12. **X-Ray Attack** – A hidden attack where a piece indirectly attacks through another piece.
13. **Windmill** – A repeated series of checks and captures, usually with a bishop and rook working together.
14. **Back-Rank Checkmate** – Delivering checkmate when an opponent’s king is trapped by its own pieces on the back rank.

This covers the core tactics from the article in a concise list!

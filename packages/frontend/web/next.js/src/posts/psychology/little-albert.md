## Intro

The Little Albert study, conducted in 1920 by John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayne.

## Issues

### Methodological

- Lack of Scientific Rigor: Sample Size is too small and No Control Group => unclear of causation.
- Questionable Validity: The response from Albert might be inconsistencies in Albertâ€™s behavior.
- No neurological and psychology test was done before and after the experiment => unsure of Little Albert's status before and after the experiment.
- Theoretical Criticism: the first experiment was done on a dog, so the human implications is much more complex (cognitive and social).

### Ethical

- Lack of Informed Consent: Little Albert's mother are not fully informed of the experiment
- Psychological Harm: Little Albert was exposed to loud and frightening noise in order to create conditioned fear response, which leads to trauma
- No Desensitization or Follow-Up Care: Although there was suggestion of reversing the fear response, no attempt was made.
- Vulnerability of the Participant: Albert was an infant, without the ability to give consent or withdraw by himself.

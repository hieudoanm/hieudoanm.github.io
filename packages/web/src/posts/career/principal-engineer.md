### üß± Microservices Architecture

- Core Principles
  - Single Responsibility: Each service owns a bounded context (DDD).
  - Loose Coupling & High Cohesion: Minimize dependencies, maximize internal focus.
  - Autonomy: Services deploy, scale, and evolve independently.
  - Decentralized Data Management: Each service manages its own database; avoid shared DB.
  - Resiliency & Observability: Circuit breakers, retries, metrics, tracing, logging.
- Benefits
  - Independent deployments (CI/CD friendly).
  - Polyglot architecture (choose best tech per service).
  - Fault isolation (failure in one service doesn‚Äôt cascade).
  - Scalability per component (e.g., scale only order service).
- Challenges
  - Data consistency (distributed transactions).
  - Operational complexity (monitoring, debugging).
  - Network latency & reliability (timeouts, retries).
  - Deployment orchestration (service discovery, configuration management).
- Design Patterns
  - Database per service
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  - Event sourcing (capture state changes as immutable events)
  - Strangler Fig Pattern (incremental migration from monolith)
- Common questions
  - What are the main challenges of microservices architecture? Hard to maintain consistency without 2PC. Use Saga/Event patterns.
    - 2PC (All for Nothing)
    - Saga Pattern
      - Break transaction into local transactions per service.
      - Each service publishes an event after completing its local action.
      - Other services react to events (Choreography) or are told what to do (Orchestration).
      - Use compensating actions to roll back (e.g., cancel payment if inventory fails).
  - Operational complexity: Monitoring, logging, tracing across services? Use correlationId and Generate at API Gateway or entry service.
  - Versioning & backward compatibility: Handle evolving contracts with API versioning and schema evolution.
  - Benefits of Orchestration
    - Centralized Workflow Control (BPMN diagrams)
    - Simpler to reason about success/failure paths compared to multiple scattered events.
    - Can trigger compensating actions immediately when a step fails.
    - Avoids ‚Äúevent storming‚Äù where multiple services react redundantly.
    - Flexible Sequencing: Can reorder or skip steps without touching multiple services.
    - Good for complex workflows (e.g., multi-step approvals, conditional branching).
    - When to Prefer Orchestration
      - Complex workflows with many steps or compensations.
      - Dynamic flows (branching, conditional logic).
      - When you need auditability and monitoring of workflows.
- Inbox / Outbox
  - Outbox
    - In microservices, dual writes happen often:
      - Write to local DB (business state).
      - Publish event to message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
    - Ensure that when you update a database and publish an event, both happen atomically.
      - How It Works
        - When processing a command, write both:
          - Business data (e.g., order table)
          - Event data (e.g., outbox table) into the same database transaction.
        - A separate process (or Kafka Connect/Debezium) reads outbox table and publishes the event to Kafka.
        - After successful publish, mark outbox entry as processed (or delete).
    - Benefits
      - Guarantees no lost events (DB and event always in sync).
      - Avoids dual write problem without 2PC.
      - Works well with Kafka + relational DB.
    - Trade-offs
      - Extra outbox table management (cleanup, indexes).
      - Slight latency between DB commit and event publish.
      - Need idempotent consumers (events may be delivered at least once).
  - Inbox
    - Goal
      - Ensure idempotent event consumption (avoid double-processing events).
    - How It Works
      - Consumer stores event ID in inbox table when processing event.
      - Before processing, check if event ID exists:
        - If exists ‚Üí ignore (duplicate).
        - If not ‚Üí process and insert into inbox.
    - Benefits
      - Ensures exactly-once processing in consumer.
      - Protects against replayed or duplicate messages.
    - Trade-offs
      - Requires storage for inbox table.
      - More DB writes on consumers.
- Kafka
  - Topic
    - A log-structured data stream.
    - Append-only; events are immutable.
    - Divided into partitions ‚Üí allows horizontal scaling and parallel consumption.
    - Each message has an offset (position in partition).
  - Consumer Groups
    - Group of consumers sharing the same group ID.
    - Kafka assigns partitions to consumers ‚Üí ensures load balancing.
    - Within a group:
      - Each partition consumed by only one consumer (scales horizontally).
    - Multiple groups can consume the same topic independently (e.g., analytics vs billing).
  - Examples
    - `order.events` contains all order-related events: `OrderCreated`, `OrderPaid`, `OrderShipped`.
    - events are distributed by partition key (e.g., orderId):
  - Retention
    - Kafka stores events for a configurable period (e.g., 7 days).
    - Consumers can replay events by resetting offsets (great for recovery/debugging).
  - Delivery Semantics
    - At-least-once (default).
      - Each message is delivered one or more times.
      - Duplicates may occur, but no message is lost.
      - Consumer processes message first, then commits offset (auto or manual).
      - If crash happens after processing but before commit, message is re-delivered.
    - At-most-once (manual offset commit control).
      - Each message is delivered zero or one time.
      - No duplicates, but possible data loss.
      - Commit offset before processing message.
      - If crash occurs after commit but before processing, message is lost.
    - Exactly-once (requires idempotent producers + transactional APIs).
      - Each message is delivered once and only once (no duplicates, no loss).
      - Idempotent Producer (enable.idempotence=true) -> ensures no duplicates during retries.
      - Transactional API -> ensures atomic writes + offset commits.
  - Why Kafka is Popular in Microservices
    - Offset
      - Offset = sequential ID for each record within a partition.
      - Starts at 0, increments by 1 per message.
      - Identifies a unique position in a partition.
    - High throughput + horizontal scalability (millions of messages/sec).
    - Replayability: Consumers can reprocess past events (e.g., rebuild state).
    - Decoupled architecture: Multiple consumers read same event independently.
    - Event sourcing & CQRS: Naturally supports state rebuild and projections.
      - Store different states (Instead of storing order: {status: SHIPPED}, store: OrderCreated, OrderPaid, OrderShipped)
    - Strong ordering within partitions: Good for workflows per entity (e.g., per order ID).
    - Schema Registry
      - Definition
        - Service that manages schemas (Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf) for Kafka topics.
        - Producers and consumers register and validate schemas to ensure compatibility.
      - How It Works
        - Each schema gets an ID stored in Kafka message header.
        - Consumer fetches schema by ID ‚Üí deserializes message correctly.
        - Supports schema evolution (backward/forward/full compatibility).
      - Key points
        - Always add default values for new fields (avoid breaking old consumers).
        - Avoid removing fields ‚Äî mark them as deprecated instead.
        - Choose compatibility mode based on rollout strategy (backward is safest).
        - Use Schema Registry‚Äôs versioning to manage multiple schema versions in parallel.
        - When using Kafka Connect or CDC, schemas evolve automatically with registry checks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Apache Kafka

- Concepts:
  - Topics, partitions, consumer groups, offset management
  - At-least-once vs. exactly-once semantics
- Use Cases: Event sourcing, change data capture (CDC), stream processing
- Tools: Kafka Streams, Kafka Connect, schema registry (e.g., Avro with Confluent)

### ‚òïÔ∏è Java + Spring Boot

- Core knowledge:
  - Spring Boot Autoconfiguration, Profiles, Actuators
  - Dependency injection with Spring Framework
  - Exception handling, validation, and AOP
- Advanced topics:
  - Spring Cloud: Config, Discovery, Gateway
  - Reactive programming (WebFlux) ‚Äì especially with Kafka or streaming
  - Observability with Spring Boot: Micrometer, Prometheus, Zipkin
- Difference between abstract class and interface?
  - Purpose: Base class for related objects; partial implementation vs Contract/behavior without implementation
  - Inheritance: A class can extend one abstract class vs A class can implement multiple interfaces
  - Constructor: Can define constructors (called by subclasses) vs No constructors (no state to initialize)
  - Access Modifiers: Can use any (private, protected, etc.) vs All methods are implicitly public abstract (Java 8 default/static methods are public)
  - Use Case: When classes share code/state vs When classes share behavior contract but differ in implementation
- SOLID

- S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
  - A class should have only one reason to change.
  - One class = one responsibility = one axis of change.
  - E.g: OrderService only does Order, InvoiceService only does Invoice
- O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
  - Add new functionality by extending classes, not modifying them.

```java
interface PaymentMethod {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void pay() { /* ... */ }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void pay() { /* ... */ }
}

class PaymentService {
    public void processPayment(PaymentMethod method) {
        method.pay();
    }
}
```

- L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

```java
abstract class Bird { }

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() { /* ... */ }
}
```

- I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don‚Äôt use.
  - Prefer multiple specific interfaces over one large interface.

```java
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
}

class Human implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
    public void eat() { /* ... */ }
}
```

- D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
  - Both should depend on abstractions.

```java
interface Database {
    void saveOrder(Order order);
}

class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    public void saveOrder(Order order) { /* ... */ }
}

class OrderService {
    private Database db;
    public OrderService(Database db) {
        this.db = db;
    }
    public void save(Order order) {
        db.saveOrder(order);
    }
}
```

  - Switch traffic to Green (DNS, load balancer, or routing change).
  - LaunchDarkly
- API Gateway + BFF (Backend For Frontend)
  - API Gateway: A single entry point for all client requests to backend services.
  - Handles:
    - Routing
    - Aggregation
    - Authentication/Authorization
    - Rate limiting
    - Caching
    - Logging/Monitoring
  - Backend For Frontend (BFF)
    - Definition
      - A dedicated backend layer per frontend (e.g., Web, Mobile, Smart TV).
      - Tailors APIs to frontend-specific needs (data shape, latency, features).
    - Why Use It?
      - Avoids over-fetching/under-fetching (common with mobile apps).
      - Allows separate release cycles for frontend and backend.
      - Simplifies frontend logic ‚Äî no need to aggregate multiple microservice calls.
  - Front-end -> API Gateway -> BFF -> Microserivces -> return packages that front-end needs
- Backpressure handling (rate limiting, bulkheads)
  - What it is
    - Occurs when producers send data faster than consumers can process.
    - Leads to queue buildup, memory exhaustion, timeouts, or crashes.
    - Common in message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), HTTP APIs, streaming systems.
  - Backpressure Handling Techniques
    - Rate Limiting
      - Restrict incoming requests to avoid overwhelming system.
      - Implemented at API Gateway, load balancer, or service level.
    - Bulkheads
      - Isolate resources into compartments so failure in one doesn‚Äôt affect others.
      - Named after ship bulkheads (watertight compartments).
      - Separate thread pools / connection pools per client or feature.
      - Example: Reserve DB pool for payment service separate from analytics.
    - Circuit Breakers
      - Open circuit when failures exceed threshold ‚Üí block calls temporarily.
      - Allows system to recover without constant failing calls.
      - Often paired with retry + fallback mechanisms.
    - Backpressure in Streaming (Reactive Systems)
      - Protocols like Reactive Streams or frameworks like Project Reactor, Akka implement pull-based flow control:
    - Queue Length Monitoring
      - Monitor queue depth (Kafka lag, RabbitMQ queue length).

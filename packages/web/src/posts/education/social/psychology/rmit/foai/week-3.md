## In The Future with AI and Data Science

### AI Boundaries and Future Directions

### Data Science Basics

- Behind every intelligent system - from recommendation engines to voice assistants - lies something crucial: data.
  - Data is a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.
  - Types of data
    - Tabular (e.g., CSV, Excel files with numbers and categories)
    - Textual (tweets, emails)
    - Audio (podcasts, voice commands)
    - Visual (images, videos)
- What is Data Science?
  - But how do we make sense of data? How do we turn raw information into useful insights or actions? That’s where data science comes in.
    - Data science combines maths and statistics, specialised programming, AI and machine learning to uncover insights hidden in an organisation's data. [IBM]
  - In short, data science is about extracting insights and knowledge from data.
    - We have learned from last week that powerful AI systems like deep learning needs a lot of data and computing power. That's when data science comes in - to help manage and make sense of the massive (unstructured) datasets needed to train these systems.
    - Datasets
      - MNIST
        - 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each 28x28 pixels.
        - Used for: Digit recognition and basic image classification tasks.
      - CIFAR-10
        - A dataset of 60,000 small (32x32) colour images across 10 categories (e.g., aeroplane, dog, truck).
        - Used for: Image classification, object recognition, image retrieval, segmentation tasks.
      - CheXpert
        - A large dataset of chest X-rays and associated reports from Stanford Medicine (over 200,000 images).
        - Used for: Medical AI development, especially for detecting lung and heart conditions.
      - Waymo dataset
        - High-resolution data collected from autonomous vehicles, including LiDAR, camera footage, and maps
        - Used for: Self-driving car research — object detection, motion prediction, lane tracking.

### Review and Reflect

- Woebot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to support mental health through conversation, making it a real-world example of AI used in healthcare and therapy.
- Philosophy helps us think about ethics, consciousness, and the societal impact of AI—especially when imagining long-term futures.
- A text corpus is the standard term in AI and linguistics for a large, structured set of text data used for analysis or training models.
- Object recognition is a fundamental computer vision task where AI identifies and labels objects within images.
- .csv (comma-separated values) is a widely used file format for storing structured tabular data, especially in data science and machine learning.

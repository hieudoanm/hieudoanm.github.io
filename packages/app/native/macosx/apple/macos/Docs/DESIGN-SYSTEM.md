# Design System

The rules the UI follows, and the tokens it follows them with.

Code is the source of truth: `Sources/Views/Shared/DesignSystem/`. This document
explains *why* those values exist and what to do when a screen needs something
new. Where the two disagree, the code is the system and this file is the bug.

---

## 1. Scope

This is the app's own layer on top of macOS, not a re-skin of it. SF Symbols,
system colours, the semantic text styles and the HIG are the platform layer and
are used directly. What lives here is the delta: the spacing rhythm, the two
surface geometries, and the handful of pieces that repeat across sections.

## 2. Principles

Inherited from `AGENTS.md` §20, restated as decisions:

| Principle | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Native first** | System controls, system colours, SF Symbols. Never a colour the app invented. |
| **Minimal** | Every element earns its place; a screen with two jobs does not get a third. |
| **Fast** | A click opens instantly. Nothing waits on a network or a sleep. |
| **Quiet** | The utility disappears. No bounce, no glow, no attention-seeking motion. |
| **Accurate** | A wrong number shown beautifully is still wrong. Unknown state says so. |

## 3. Surfaces

Two surfaces, one window, and they are deliberately different (`ContentLayout`).

| | Panel | Window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry | Menu-bar popover | `⇧⌘D`, Dock icon while open |
| Width | 600pt fixed | 1100×760, resizable to 820×560 |
| Navigation | Tab bar across the top | Sidebar, alphabetical groups |
| Content | One section at a time, behind a picker | One route per screen, plus cards for sub-sections |
| Chrome | Section header, divider, picker | Toolbar title, subtitle, cards |

The rule behind it: the panel competes with the rest of the screen, so it shows
one thing well; the window has room, so it shows several things at once and lets
the sidebar carry the navigation.

## 4. Tokens

All in `Sources/Views/Shared/DesignSystem/`. Raw numbers for spacing, radius,
colour opacity and duration are **banned** outside these files — `DesignSystemTests`
fails the build if one appears.

### 4.1 `Spacing` — the 4pt grid

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hairline` | 2 | A label stacked on its value |
| `iconGap` | 3 | An icon against its label |
| `xxs` | 4 | Badge insets, tight lines |
| `tight` | 5 | Label-to-value pairs that want air |
| `xs` | 6 | Inside a capsule control |
| `sm` | 8 | Between related rows |
| `compact` | 10 | System capsule inset |
| `md` | 12 | Between blocks, card gutters |
| `inset` | 14 | Panel section inset |
| `lg` | 16 | Card padding |
| `section` | 18 | Between a screen's head and body |
| `xl` | 20 | Card header to content |
| `xxl` | 24 | Between groups on a screen |
| `xxxl` | 28 | Window screen inset |
| `huge` | 40 | Around an empty state |
| `giant` | 48 | Empty state inside a card |

`iconGap`, `tight`, `compact`, `inset` and `section` are off-grid on purpose:
they match macOS's own control insets so the app sits correctly beside system
UI. Everything else is on the grid.

### 4.2 `Radius`

`small` 6 (details) · `medium` 8 (controls, badges) · `large` 10 (cards).
A surface is exactly one of the three.

### 4.3 `Palette` — semantic colours only

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cardFill` | `primary` 4% | Card background |
| `controlFill` | `primary` 8% | Unselected control, row |
| `track` | `primary` 12% | Unfilled ring, progress track |
| `stroke` | `primary` 15% | Hairline, card outline |
| `tint(_:)` | any colour 15% | Badge wash |
| `dimmed` / `faint` | `secondary` / `primary` 40% | Placeholder, missing value, second hand |
| `quietFill` / `quietText` | `quaternary` 40% / `secondary` 60% | A tile with no state; a unit |
| `muted` | `primary` 60% | Secondary hand |
| `lead` | `primary` 80% | The value that leads a screen of values |
| `pin` | `primary` 20% | Analog face pin |
| `shadow` | `black` 15% | Elevation |

Because every value is a semantic colour at a fixed opacity, the whole app
adapts to Light Mode, Dark Mode and increased transparency without a single
hard-coded colour. Feature colours (usage thresholds via `UsageThresholdColor`,
clock phase tints) belong to the feature, not to `Palette`.

### 4.4 `Typography`

Prose uses macOS semantic styles directly — `.headline` for a card or screen
title, `.subheadline` for a value, `.caption`/`.caption2` for supporting text.
Wrapping those in a token only adds indirection.

Tokens exist for what semantic styles cannot express: `emptyStateIcon` 28,
`emptyStateIconLarge` 48, `emptyStateTitle` 44, `percentage` 30 semibold,
`digitalReadout` 52 monospaced, `ringReadout` 40 monospaced, and `readoutCap`
40 — the ceiling a clock readout scales to.

Any number that changes more than once a second is monospaced, so digits do not
shuffle horizontally as they tick.

### 4.5 `Motion`

The app animates values, never decoration, so all durations are linear: easing a
number that ticks every frame reads as lag.

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tick` | 0.02s | A readout that changes as fast as the clock ticks |
| `ring` | 0.5s | Countdown ring sweeping to the next second |
| `face` | 1.0s | Watchface second hand |
| `crossfade` | 0.15s | The panel's tab crossfade — the only eased animation in the app |

Anything that moves a view must respect `accessibilityReduceMotion`.

### 4.6 `SurfaceMetrics`

Panel: `panelWidth` 600, `panelPadding` = `Spacing.inset`, icon button
22×20. Window: 1100×760, minimum 820×560, screen inset `28 / 20`, sidebar 200
(170–280). Cards: `cardHeight` 320, `cardMinHeight` 140, `cardPadding`
`Spacing.lg`, refresh button 24×24. Clock faces: ring 160…320 at 0.7 fill,
watchface 200…380 at 0.9 fill.

A control's size is a parameter (`CircleIconButton(size:)`), not a global token —
what matters is that the same control looks the same everywhere.

## 5. Components

| Component | File | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SectionCard` | `Views/Shared/` | A titled card in the window grid. Fixed height so an inner list has something to scroll inside. |
| `SectionGrid` | `Views/Shared/` | Lays cards into as many columns as the width allows. `cardHeight` is explicit: a card that holds a list needs a height to scroll inside. |
| `ChipButton` | `DesignSystem/` | Choosing one of a few known options: presets, faces. |
| `CapsuleBadge` | `DesignSystem/` | A short label that states something and cannot be pressed. |
| `CircleIconButton` | `DesignSystem/` | Round icon controls: clock reset, play/pause, lap, stop. |
| `ClipboardListPane` | `Views/Clipboard/` | Search field, count, list, empty state — the shared clipboard body. |
| `InfoRow` / `JSONText` | `Views/IP/` | A label and its value; a raw payload block. |
| `ResourceMeter` | `Views/Shared/` | Used/total with a proportional bar and a percentage. |
| `UnavailableView` | `Views/Shared/` | The one way to say "this cannot be read". |
| `ClockRing` / `ClockFaceSizing` | `Views/Clock/` | Countdown ring; face sizing that keeps a face square. |
| `ApplicationsSidebarGroup` / `ClipboardSidebarGroup` / `ClockSidebarGroup` | `Views/*/` | Sidebar groups, in that order. |
| `SearchField` | `DesignSystem/` | The one search field: rounded quiet fill, plain text field, clear button. |
| `ContentLayout` | `Views/Shared/` | `.panel` vs `.window`, so one view serves both surfaces. |

When a pattern appears three times, it becomes a component. When it appears
twice, it stays local until the third arrives.

## 6. Patterns

**Panel tab** — header with section name, divider, segmented picker, divider,
body, panel padding. The picker filters or switches a sub-section; in the window
that same choice becomes its own route.

**Window screen** — toolbar title and subtitle, then one route: either a
centred, padded single body (`Spacing.xxxl` / `Spacing.xl`) or a card grid. A
window screen is never a card grid *and* a picker.

**Card grid** — sub-sections of one section, side by side, each a `SectionCard`
with a definite height.

**Filtered list** — search field, item count, list, empty state. Empty state
first names the filter: "No images copied yet", not "No results".

**Empty state** — a 28pt SF Symbol, a 44pt headline, one sentence saying what
would fill it.

**Value tile** — label in `.caption`, value in `.subheadline` (or a display font
when the number *is* the tile), optional badge.

**Sidebar search** — one `SearchField` above the sidebar list. A query narrows the
groups: an empty group is not drawn at all, and a query that names an installed
app adds it as a destination of its own (`DashboardRoute.app`), so picking it
opens the Apps screen already filtered. An empty result says what it searched
for, in quotes. A filter that navigates is a sidebar row; a filter over one list
is a `SearchField` inside that screen.

## 7. Rules

1. Spacing, radius, colour opacity and duration come from tokens. No exceptions,
   no "just this once".
2. Semantic system colours only. A hard-coded colour needs a reason in the
   commit that adds it.
3. One primary action per surface. The window toolbar carries refresh and
   settings; nothing else.
4. The panel has a tab bar; the window has a sidebar and never a tab bar.
5. Sidebar groups are alphabetical; rows inside a group keep their meaningful
   order (Applications still reads Apps → Homebrew).
6. Every icon-only control carries an accessibility label; decorative symbols
   are marked `accessibilityHidden`.
7. Anything that ticks is monospaced and digits-only.
8. A card that holds a list has a fixed height.
9. Unknown is a state, not a zero. Never render `0 GB` for a failed read.
10. A new token is added to the smallest file that owns its concern, with a
    comment saying what it is for.

## 8. Anti-patterns

**A magic number in a view.** `.padding(14)` is a decision nobody made.
→ `Spacing.inset`.

**A token used to mean something it does not.** `Spacing.md` is not "the padding
under this one header". → Add a token with a name, or use the closest real one.

**A hard-coded colour.** `Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.3, blue: 0.4)` breaks Dark
Mode. → A semantic colour, or `Palette`.

**A control that only nearly matches another.** The stopwatch's lap button must
look like the timer's play button. → `CircleIconButton`, not a fourth copy.

**A filter that looks like navigation.** A segmented control over one list is a
filter and belongs in the panel; in the window it becomes separate screens.

**Two surfaces pretending to be one screen.** Copying a view to make a window
variant means the two drift. → `ContentLayout`.

**Animation on a number that ticks.** Anything under a second should be linear,
or nothing.

**A tab bar in the window.** The window has room for a sidebar and cards; tabs
throw that away.

**Wrapping a semantic font in a token.** `.font(Typography.caption)` is worse
than `.font(.caption)`. Semantic styles are the system of record.

## 9. Content and voice

- Sentence case. No exclamation marks, ever.
- Ellipsis `…` when an action opens or changes something ("Open Dashboard…").
- Empty states name the filter that produced them, in the present tense:
  "Nothing pinned yet".
- Errors state what failed and what to try, not what went wrong internally.
- Units ride with the number ("12.4 GB", "3 min"), never in a separate column.

## 10. Governance

**Changing a token** — edit the file, then `swift test`. `DesignSystemTests`
pins the scale order, the grid, and the surface geometry, so a change is a
deliberate edit in two places and shows up in review as one.

**Adding a component** — it lives in `DesignSystem/` if more than one section
uses it, next to the views that use it if only one does. Update §5 of this file
in the same change.

**Verifying** — `swift build`, `swift test`, then look at the app: `make dev`.
Check Light Mode, Dark Mode, increased transparency and Reduce Motion. The
token guard catches drift; only looking catches ugliness.

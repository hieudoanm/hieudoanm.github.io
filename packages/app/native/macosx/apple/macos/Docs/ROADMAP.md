- [x] Configurable refresh interval (presets shipped in v1)
- [x] Configurable menu-bar display
- [ ] Threshold customization

## Phase 7 — Port Monitoring

> Developer view for discovering and managing local listening ports,
> migrated from the standalone Ports app.

- [x] `PortInfo` / `NetworkEndpoint` models in MacOSXCore
- [x] `lsof`-based discovery service (`LsofPortDiscoveryService`)
- [x] Defensive `lsof` output parsing (`LsofParser`)
- [x] `ProcessTerminating` protocol and `SignalProcessTerminator` (SIGTERM / SIGKILL)
- [x] `PortsViewModel` sharing the MacOSX `SettingsStore.refreshInterval`
- [x] Dedicated Ports tab in the popover (search, list, kill action)
- [x] Monitor and Ports as two tabs with Monitor the default (renamed to
      Memory when the Clipboard tab was added)
- [ ] Open port in browser action
- [ ] Project detection for development servers

## Phase 8 — Clipboard History

> Clipboard manager migrated from the standalone Clipper app.

- [x] `ClipboardItem` / `ClipboardStore` models in MacOSXCore (dedupe, pin, cap,
      atomic JSON persistence at `Application Support/Clipper/clipboard.json`)
- [x] `ClipboardMonitor` (0.5 s `changeCount` poll) and single access point
      `PasteboardManager`
- [x] `ClipboardViewModel` sharing monitor state and max-history prefs with Settings
- [x] Dedicated Clipboard tab in the popover (search, copy, pin, delete,
      clear unpinned)
- [x] Clipboard section in Settings (monitor toggle, max history picker)
- [ ] Rich-text / image clipboard support
- [ ] Snippets with custom names

## Phase 9 — IP Inspector

> Public IP inspector migrated from the web IP tool.

- [x] `IPInfo` / `DNSResponse` models in MacOSXCore
- [x] `IPLookupService` (ipify → ipinfo → ipapi fallback, Cloudflare DNS-over-HTTPS)
- [x] Pure `IPInfoParsing` (normalise both providers, `detectVPN`, offline
      classification) with unit tests
- [x] Dedicated IP tab in the popover between Clipboard and Memory
      (geolocation rows, raw JSON, VPN badge, map link, DNS lookup)
- [x] Offline state shown distinctly from generic errors
- [ ] Custom DNS record types / IPv6 queries

## Phase 10 — Running Apps (Front)

> Bring any running app's windows to the front, in one click.

- [x] `RunningAppInfo` model and `RunningAppProviding` protocol in MacOSXCore
- [x] `RunningAppsDiscoveryService` (NSWorkspace list filtered to regular apps,
      on-screen window counts, sorted by localized name) with unit tests
- [x] Dedicated Front tab in the popover (searchable list, window counts,
      bring-all-windows-to-front)
- [x] 2-second refresh while the tab is visible
- [ ] Activate by bundle identifier search history / favorites

## Phase 11 — Workspaces

> Save the apps and window positions you use, then restore them after a boot,
> migrated from the standalone Snap app.

- [x] `Workspace` / `WorkspaceWindow` / `NormalizedRect` / `ScreenInfo` models
      in MacOSXCore
- [x] `WorkspaceStore` (atomic JSON persistence at
      `Application Support/Workspaces/workspaces.json`) with unit tests
- [x] Capture via `CoreGraphicsWindowLister` (layer-0 on-screen windows,
      bundle IDs from `NSRunningApplication`) and `WorkspaceWindowBuilder`
      (normalize to screen visible frames) with unit tests
- [x] `CoordinateConverter` mapping normalized ↔ absolute coordinates, with
      unit tests
- [x] Restore that launches missing apps in parallel and arranges windows via
      the Accessibility (AX) APIs (`WorkspaceRestoreService`, `WindowArranger`)
- [x] Multi-monitor: windows restore to the saved display ID, falling back to
      the primary display
- [x] Dedicated Workspaces tab (last) with the in-tab Accessibility Grant
      banner and per-restore summary
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut to toggle workspaces popover
- [ ] Auto-arrange on login / after wake
- [ ] Overwrite-in-place ("re-save" edits the current snapshot)

## Phase 12 — Battery

> Full battery monitoring via the IOKit power-source APIs.

- [x] `BatteryInfo` model and pure `BatteryInfoParsing` in MacOSXCore (folds
      unknown/unlimited time sentinels into `nil`) with unit tests
- [x] `BatteryMonitor` reading charge, power source, charging, time to
      empty/full, health condition and adapter wattage
- [x] `AppleSmartBattery` / `PowerManagementController` registry read for cycle
      count and temperature (deci-kelvin normalised on Intel)
- [x] Dedicated Battery tab (first, alphabetical) with charge bar, overview and
      detail rows, refreshing while the popover is open
- [x] `Battery unavailable` state on Macs without a readable battery
- [ ] Charge history / time-series chart
- [ ] Low-battery and charge-limit notifications

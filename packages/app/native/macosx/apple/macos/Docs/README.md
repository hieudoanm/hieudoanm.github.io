## 1. Product vision

MacOSX is a lightweight native macOS menu-bar utility for monitoring **RAM usage** and **disk storage usage** at a glance. The primary UI is a compact menu-bar indicator showing current usage. Clicking it opens a popover containing detailed memory and storage information.

MacOSX answers one question:

> **How much memory and storage am I using right now?**

The first version focuses exclusively on:

- RAM usage
- Disk/storage usage
- Percentage used
- Used / total values
- Compact progress indicators
- Menu-bar presentation
- Lightweight resource consumption

The application should feel like a **small, native macOS utility**, not a web application.

## Product principles

**Native first** — SwiftUI, AppKit, SF Symbols, system colours, native controls. Never Tauri, Electron, React, or WebView.

**Minimal** — Every UI element must have a purpose.

**Fast** — Opening the popover should feel instantaneous.

**Quiet** — MacOSX should stay out of the user's way.

**Accurate** — Never sacrifice correctness for a visually convenient number. Unknown state says so; never render `0 GB` for a failed read.

**Resource-conscious** — A system monitor that consumes significant resources is self-defeating (~0% idle CPU, <50 MB memory).

### The product promise

A tiny, beautiful system resource meter that you forget is running until you need it.

## 2. Target users

| Persona      | Primary need                    | Desired outcome                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| End user     | Know RAM and disk usage at a glance | Instant, native menu-bar visibility  |
| Power user   | Monitor ports, clipboard, apps, IP, network, battery, workspaces | Full system oversight from one utility |

Primary persona: a macOS user who wants a lightweight, native menu-bar meter for memory and storage, with optional deeper system monitoring tabs.

## 3. Scope and priorities

- **P0** — Core platform: necessary for the first usable release (RAM, disk, menu-bar indicator, popover).
- **P1** — Enhancement: important for a complete experience (ports, clipboard, front/apps, IP, network, battery, workspaces, dashboard window).

The first release should deliver RAM and disk monitoring extremely well rather than an incomplete version of every feature.

## 4. Functional requirements

See [`01-requirements.md`](01-requirements.md) for the complete specification.

### P0 — Core platform

Memory usage (used/total, percentage), disk usage (used/total, percentage), menu-bar indicator, popover with details.

### P1 — Enhancement

Swap, CPU, system info, battery, network throughput, port discovery, clipboard history, running apps, workspaces, IP inspector, dashboard window.

## 5. User journeys

See [`03-user-stories.md`](03-user-stories.md) for the complete user-goal and acceptance-scenario specification.

### Journey A — Check memory and disk at a glance

Goal: know current RAM and disk usage without opening anything.

1. Glance at the menu bar (`RAM 39%   Disk 83%`).
2. Click to open the popover.
3. Read the Memory and Storage sections with progress bars and used/total values.

Success metric: menu-bar percentages are visible and accurate within one second of opening the popover.

### Journey B — Deep-dive into a specific metric

Goal: inspect detailed breakdown for one subsystem.

1. Open the popover.
2. Select the desired tab (Memory, Network, Ports, Battery, etc.).
3. Read the details view (breakdowns, session totals, per-interface rows, etc.).

Success metric: each tab loads instantly and shows its full detail set without navigation delay.

### Journey C — Save and restore a workspace layout

Goal: restore app window positions after a reboot or display switch.

1. Arrange windows as desired.
2. Open the Workspaces tab and save a named workspace.
3. Later, click Restore; missing apps launch and windows return to saved positions.

Success metric: captured windows restore to the correct display and position; Accessibility grant banner appears when permission is missing.

## 6. Application structure

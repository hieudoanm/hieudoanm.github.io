```bash
git clone https://github.com/hieudoanm/hieudoanm.github.io.git
cd packages/app/headless/jack/go
make build          # native build → bin/jack
# or cross-compile all four platforms:
# make build-all    # requires zig (see PACKAGING)
./bin/jack version
```

See [PACKAGING](PACKAGING) for the CI artifact pipeline and

## About

Jack is a batteries-included CLI. Everything is one command away:

- **System monitoring** and **network diagnostics**.
- **PDF, image, and video processing**.
- **Crypto hashes** and **semver**.
- **Color conversion**, **search**, and **time tools**.
- **Chess analysis**, **Telegram**, **games**, and **AI chat**.

All via cobra subcommands with a uniform `--json` flag.

---

## Features

- **33 modules** — from `calc`, `crypto`, `file` and `search` to `pdf`,
  `video`, `image`, `web`, `telegram` and `write`
- **`--json`** — machine-readable output on 28 modules for scripts
- **AI chat** — `gemini code` and `openrouter code` TUI sessions
- **MCP server** — `jack mcp serve` exposes all 189 leaf commands as tools to
  AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code) over stdio
- **Command history** — every invocation tracked in `~/.jack/history.jsonl`
  (`jack history list/search/stats`, `jack history clear`)
- **Shell completion** — `jack completion <bash|zsh|fish|powershell>`
- **Cross-platform** — linux/macOS × amd64/arm64 binaries

---

## MCP setup

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "jack": { "command": "jack", "args": ["mcp", "serve"] } } }
```

Tools are named with dot notation matching the CLI path — `file.read`,
`search.files`, `calc.bmi`, `time.clock.now`.

---

## First run

- `jack --help` and `jack <module> --help` show the full module tree
- Command history is written to `~/.jack/history.jsonl` (managed with
  `jack history clear`)

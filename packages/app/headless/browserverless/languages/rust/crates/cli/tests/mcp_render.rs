//! Real-render regression test for the Servo-backed MCP renderer.
//!
//! Servo initialises process-wide state that panics when a second browser is
//! constructed, so this file deliberately contains a single test: two tests
//! would build two browsers in one process and panic. `serve_api.rs` is a
//! separate test binary, and so a separate process, so it may own its own
//! browser.

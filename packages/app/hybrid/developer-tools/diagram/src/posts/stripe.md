# Stripe — Payments

Payments API, idempotency, PSP authorization, ledger, webhooks, fraud.

## Interview Questions

- Design Stripe / an online payment platform
- How do you guarantee exactly-once charge semantics?
- Why does idempotency matter in payment APIs?
- How do you reconcile money across ledgers and banks?
- Design webhook delivery with retries and backoff

## Answers

### Q1. Design Stripe / an online payment platform

The system is built from a set of core services:

- A Payments API fronting a Payments Service.
- An abstraction over PSP networks for authorization and settlement.
- A Ledger Service writing double-entry records.
- A wallet/balance system.
- A webhook dispatcher.
- Fraud screening.
- Notifications.

The transactional store is a single-write, ACID database partitioned by account
so charges and ledger entries commit atomically.

Data models: transactions, payment methods, ledger entries, balances.

Trade-offs: correctness demands a strongly consistent ledger, so writes funnel
through one source of truth while reads scale via caching and replication.

To scale:

- Shard by account/merchant.
- Add idempotency caching for retries.
- Decouple webhooks through a durable queue.

Settlement is async:

- Authorize synchronously, then settle or refund through the PSP with
  reconciliation against bank statements.

### Q2. How do you guarantee exactly-once charge semantics?

True exactly-once is impossible across networks, so the standard is
at-least-once delivery plus idempotent deduplication at the application layer.

- The client sends an `Idempotency-Key` on every charge.
- The Payments Service performs an atomic check-and-set against an idempotency
  cache/table keyed by (account, key).
- On a miss it executes the charge and stores the result and response body
  together in one transaction; on a hit it returns the previously stored result
  instead of charging again.
- PSP calls are retried with the same key so the network's own idempotency
  shields double auths.
- Ledger entries are written once with unique entry IDs.
- A background reconciler compares ledger balances against PSP settlement
  reports to catch and fix residual drift.

### Q3. Why does idempotency matter in payment APIs?

Payments sit behind unreliable networks: a client timeout or gateway retry can
fire after a charge already succeeded, and without protection that retry creates
a second, accidental charge.

- Idempotency keys let the server recognize a repeated request and replay the
  original response, making retries safe.
- They give clients a simple contract — retry with backoff until you get a
  definitive answer.
- This prevents double charges, keeps merchant and customer balances consistent,
  and avoids expensive manual refunds.
- On the backend it translates to a keyed store with an atomic insert and a TTL,
  so duplicates are cheaply deduped without re-running the PSP flow.
- It also composes with eventing: webhook events carry the same idempotent IDs
  so downstream consumers dedupe consistently.

### Q4. How do you reconcile money across ledgers and banks?

The ledger is the system of record: every money movement is posted as
double-entry journal entries so debits and credits always balance.

- Wallet balances are derived projections of that ledger, not independent
  stores.
- Reconciliation matches the internally consistent ledger against external
  bank/PSP settlement files, typically nightly.
- Each line — charges, refunds, fees, chargebacks — is paired with a ledger
  entry, and unmatched items go to a discrepancy queue for investigation.
- Posting must be idempotent, using unique entry IDs, so repeated settlement
  files cannot double-count.
- Anomalies like failed debits or surprise network fees are auto-flagged.
- When totals drift, you bisect the batch to isolate the mismatch.
- This gives a provable money trail and catches bugs before they hit customer
  balances.

### Q5. Design webhook delivery with retries and backoff

The webhook dispatcher reads events from a durable queue (SQS/Kafka) and POSTs
them to each merchant's registered endpoint.

- Delivery policy: HTTP 2xx marks success; timeouts and non-2xx trigger retry
  with exponential backoff plus jitter (e.g., 1s to 2s to 4s capped, max
  attempts roughly 5-10), after which the event moves to a dead-letter queue for
  manual replay.
- Every payload is signed with an HMAC and carries a unique event ID so
  merchants can verify authenticity and dedupe.
- The dispatcher must respect per-endpoint rate limits and honor
  `Retry-After`/429s to avoid hammering slow servers.
- Provide a dashboard with delivery logs and one-click replay.
- Emit metrics on delivery latency and failure rates for alerting.

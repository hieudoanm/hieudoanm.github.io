# Dropbox — File Sync

Desktop sync client, chunked upload, metadata service, block storage,
versioning.

## Interview Questions

- Design Dropbox / a file sync service
- How do you detect and sync file changes efficiently?
- Why store files as content-addressed blocks?
- How do you handle concurrent edits to the same file?
- Design version history and rollback

## Answers

### Q1. Design Dropbox / a file sync service

Clients watch the filesystem for changes, split files into fixed-size blocks,
and compute content hashes so only new blocks upload.

- An API gateway fronts upload, metadata, and sync services.
- The upload service stores blocks in object storage; the metadata service
  persists the file tree, block references, and per-client cursors in a metadata
  DB.
- Sync workers diff the client's snapshot against server state, then push or
  pull changes, with notifications telling other devices to fetch.
- Versioning snapshots preserve history as content-addressed manifests.
- Key trade-offs: dedupe at block granularity, delta sync over whole-file
  transfer, bandwidth throttling for uploads, and a well-defined conflict
  resolution policy for concurrent edits.

### Q2. How do you detect and sync file changes efficiently?

The client keeps a local snapshot of each file (size, mtime, and per-block
hashes) and compares it against the server's tree.

- Changes are detected by walking directories and re-hashing file blocks with
  SHA-256, transferring only missing or modified blocks.
- Content addressing lets you skip unchanged blocks even when the file changes
  elsewhere, and renames are handled by fingerprint rather than path.
- On the server, a sync worker compares the client's cursor against committed
  metadata and computes an add/update/delete diff.
- Incremental sync is cursor-based so each device pulls only deltas after the
  first full sync.
- Use notifications or long polling to trigger reconciliation rather than
  periodic full scans.

### Q3. Why store files as content-addressed blocks?

Splitting files into fixed-size blocks keyed by their content hash (SHA-256)
gives deduplication: identical blocks across files and users are stored once, so
a shared dependency or a duplicate upload costs nothing extra.

- It also enables efficient delta sync, since a new version references reused
  blocks and only changed ones upload.
- Content addressing provides integrity verification, because a hash mismatch
  exposes corruption, and makes blocks immutable, which simplifies replication
  and CDN caching.
- The metadata layer keeps the manifest: file id, ordered block list, and
  logical path.
- Trade-offs: block-index overhead and hashing cost on small files, so use a
  minimum file threshold or variable-size chunking (rolling hash) to balance
  dedupe against compute.

### Q4. How do you handle concurrent edits to the same file?

Use a versioned, optimistic model.

- Every accepted edit creates a new version; the server records the head version
  for each file.
- On upload the client sends the base version it edited; if the server head has
  advanced, the server rejects the write with the current version, and the
  client either fetches and retries or writes a conflict copy such as "Name
  (User's conflicted copy)".
- Commits are serialized per file via a version counter, and metadata updates
  are transactional so a stale client can never silently overwrite newer data.
- Most sync products choose last-writer-wins plus conflict copies over automatic
  three-way merge because sequential collaborators rarely collide, making the
  behavior predictable and recoverable.

### Q5. Design version history and rollback

Every committed snapshot is a manifest of content-addressed blocks, so history
is a chain of manifests in the metadata DB; versions share blocks, meaning
storage cost is only the delta.

- An API lists versions (id, author, timestamp, size).
- Restore is atomic pointer-swap: point the file's current manifest at an older
  one, with no data copy because blocks are immutable.
- Garbage-collect orphaned blocks by reference counting once no manifest
  references them.
- Retention policies thin history over time (full history for N days, then
  hourly or weekly snapshots).
- Folder-wide restore applies the same pointer-swap per file in a transaction.
- Version listing is read-heavy and served from cache.

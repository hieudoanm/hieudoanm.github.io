    "I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me break this down into clear steps:\n\n1. **First**, we need to understand the core requirements\n2. **Then**, we can design an appropriate solution\n3. **Finally**, we'll implement and test it\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these steps?",
    "That's an interesting question. Based on my analysis, here are the key points:\n\n- The solution involves multiple components working together\n- Performance should be considered at each step\n- Testing is crucial for reliability\n\nLet me know if you need more details on any aspect.",
    "Great question! Here's a comprehensive overview:\n\n```\n// Example code\nconst solution = {\n  approach: 'systematic',\n  priority: 'correctness',\n  testing: 'comprehensive'\n};\n```\n\nThis approach ensures we cover all bases while maintaining code quality.",

Often, the best solution is one that:\n\n- Solves the immediate problem\n- Anticipates future needs\n- Remains maintainable\n\nWhat aspects would you like to explore further?',
    "This is a thoughtful question. Here's my analysis:\n\n> The best code is code that doesn't need to be written, but when you must write it, make it clear and testable.\n\nConsider these approaches:\n1. Start with the simplest solution that works\n2. Refactor as patterns emerge\n3. Document your reasoning\n\nShall I dive deeper into any of these?",

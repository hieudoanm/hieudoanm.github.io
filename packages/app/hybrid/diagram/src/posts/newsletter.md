## Answers

### Q1. Design a newsletter / mailing platform

A newsletter platform is an email delivery system with an authoring product
wrapped around it. The author writes in a browser, the Campaign Service turns
the post into a scheduled send, the Subscriber Service provides the audience
list, and a Send Engine pushes the message to every recipient. Because delivery
is the core, everything downstream of the author edit is built for throughput,
deliverability, and observability. The API gateway is the entry point for
authoring, list management, and the analytics dashboard, while the actual
sending happens through queues and worker pools so the request path never blocks
on the volume of mail.

The lifecycle of a post makes the architecture clear. An author publishes, a
campaign record is created with its schedule and audience segment, and the
recipient list is resolved as a snapshot so later subscription changes do not
silently alter who receives the mail. The list is enqueued as batches into the
Send Queue, workers dispatch each batch through an email delivery provider, and
delivery reports stream back to update status and analytics. The Subscribers DB
holds the canonical audience state, while the analytics layer accumulates opens,
clicks, and bounces for the author's dashboard.

The design splits reads from writes cleanly. A campaign with a million
subscribers is a write problem solved by batching and parallelism; an author
checking open rates is a read problem solved by pre-aggregated reports. Both
paths share the same event stream: every delivery, open, and click is an event,
consumed by the analytics pipeline and by the lists that track deliverability
health. This event backbone is what lets the platform answer two questions at
once: did the campaign go out, and did anyone care about it?

### Q2. How do you send campaigns to millions of subscribers?

Sending to millions means parallelizing the send while respecting the
constraints of the internet. The campaign is broken into batches of a few
hundred recipients each, and batches are distributed across worker pools, each
of which submits to the email delivery provider or sends directly via SMTP. The
Send Queue is the buffer that absorbs rate differences: if the delivery provider
throttles, workers back off and the queue holds the remainder. A campaign of a
million recipients is therefore not one send but thousands of small sends,
spread over minutes, coordinated by a cursor so every recipient is attempted
exactly once.

Rate shaping is the art of the send. Providers and ISPs penalize senders whose
volume spikes, so the Send Engine ramps up gradually, uses warm-up profiles for
new domains, and honors per-domain and per-ISP rate limits. The queue is
partitioned by sending domain, so a problem with one domain's reputation cannot
stall the whole campaign. Delivery is distributed across multiple providers for
resilience; if one provider's throughput collapses, a circuit breaker diverts
new batches to the others. Failures are retried with backoff, and persistent
failures land in a dead-letter state for the author to see as "not delivered".

The sender reputation is the hidden currency. The platform tracks complaint
rates, bounce rates, and spam-list status per sending domain, because a single
bad campaign can burn a domain for weeks. Authentication such as DKIM and SPF is
configured per domain, and the platform monitors alignment continuously. The
design goal is a durable throughput curve, not a raw burst: the queue, the
workers, and the provider pool are all sized so that a million-recipient
campaign completes in minutes without ever tripping a reputation alarm.

### Q3. How do you handle bounces and unsubscribes?

Bounces and unsubscribes are the signal from the real world that the list
quality is changing, and handling them correctly is what keeps a sending domain
alive. A bounce is classified as hard or soft. A hard bounce, a permanently
invalid address, removes the subscriber from the list immediately and records
the reason; a soft bounce, a full mailbox or a temporarily down host, triggers a
retry with backoff, and the subscriber is only removed after a threshold of
consecutive soft bounces. The classification happens in the email ingestion
pipeline that parses provider delivery reports and SMTP bounce codes, not in the
send path, so sending workers are never blocked.

Unsubscribes must be honored with legal precision. Every campaign email carries
an unsubscribe link that resolves to a one-click endpoint, and every compliance
regime, such as CAN-SPAM and GDPR, treats a failed unsubscribe as a serious
violation. The Subscriber Service processes the unsubscribe immediately, writes
the suppression record, and propagates it through an index so no future campaign
can include that address. A global suppression list sits in front of every send,
because a user who unsubscribed from one newsletter must not be re-added by an
imported list.

The system also learns from the failure modes. A list is only as good as its
freshness, so re-engagement campaigns target subscribers who have gone cold, and
addresses that never open are gradually retired. Complaint feedback loops, where
the user marks mail as spam at the mailbox provider, feed a similar list. Bounce
and complaint rates are aggregated per domain and per campaign, and thresholds
trigger warnings to the author before a list becomes a reputation liability. All
of this is surfaced in the dashboard so the author sees deliverability as an
actionable metric, not an afterthought.

### Q4. How do you track opens and clicks?

Open tracking is a pixel that reports without the reader knowing. Each campaign
email embeds a unique tracking URL pointing at an image the client fetches, and
that request carries a per-recipient token that links the open to the subscriber
and the campaign. Because many clients block images or prefetch aggressively,
the open count is a lower bound on real reads, and the platform treats it as a
trend signal rather than an exact count. The token is opaque and single-purpose,
so recipients cannot be correlated outside the campaign context.

Click tracking wraps every link in the email. The visible href points at a
redirect service that logs the click, then forwards to the real destination.
This gives precise per-link statistics and also enables safety checks, since the
platform can flag links that resolve to known phishing or malware destinations.
Both open and click events are written to a high-throughput event stream,
batched, and aggregated per campaign, per hour, and per link so the author's
dashboard renders quickly even while events are still arriving.

Counting is harder than it looks. An event is unique per recipient per campaign,
so the pipeline deduplicates by recipient and event type; a recipient who opens
ten times counts once for "open rate" but contributes ten to "opens". Time zones
and delayed mail clients mean events arrive for days after a send, so reports
are recomputed with an as-of window. The analytics store is a columnar or
time-series database that makes per-link and per- recipient slicing fast, and
the raw event log is retained separately for audits and deeper analysis. The
result is a dashboard that answers how many people opened, clicked, and stayed
until the end.

### Q5. How do you manage paid subscriptions?

Paid subscriptions turn a mailing platform into a commerce system with a
recurring billing component. The platform integrates with a payment processor
that handles the actual card charging, while the Subscription Service owns the
business state: plan tier, status, billing period, and next renewal date. When a
reader subscribes, a checkout flow captures payment details, the processor
stores them on a tokenized vault, and the Subscription Service records the
grant, which in turn activates paid-only content access. The authoring side
exposes which posts are paywalled, and the access check runs at read time
against the subscription state.

Lifecycle events drive the system. A successful renewal extends the grant, a
failed payment starts a retry sequence with a grace period, and a subscription
that cannot be recovered downgrades to a limited state rather than vanishing.
The processor's webhooks are the source of truth for money events, and the
platform reconciles them against its own records daily so a missed webhook does
not create a silent gap. Because a subscriber can also get a refund or
chargeback, the ledger must support reversals, and the access grants are revoked
accordingly. This money path is kept deliberately separate from the email path,
so a billing outage never blocks an author from sending a post.

The product layer sits on top. Authors set prices and tiers, and the platform
handles pro-ration, coupons, and annual-versus-monthly billing through the
subscription plan model. Analytics attribute revenue to posts, so an author sees
which articles converted readers into paying subscribers. Compliance matters:
the platform issues receipts, honors tax requirements in supported
jurisdictions, and retains the audit trail that a payment business needs. The
design principle is that subscriptions are a separate bounded context,
integrated with the rest of the product only through clean interfaces for access
control and revenue reporting.

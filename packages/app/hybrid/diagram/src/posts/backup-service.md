## Answers

### Q1. Design a backup service

A backup service protects data against loss by periodically copying it to an
independent store that survives failures of the primary system. The service
needs five capabilities: scheduling, so backups happen on a policy without human
action; snapshotting, so each backup captures a consistent point-in-time;
storage, so backups are written durably and cheaply; verification, so backups
are known to be restorable; and restore, so data can be recovered quickly when
needed. A backup that cannot be restored is not a backup — it is wasted disk.

The architecture separates control from execution. A scheduler holds the backup
policy per protected asset (frequency, retention, destination) and triggers
runs. The backup engine executes each run: it coordinates a snapshot, splits it
into chunks, deduplicates against previously stored chunks, and writes new
chunks to the backup store. The store is append-mostly and immutable, which is
what protects against ransomware and accidental deletes — an attacker who
compromises the primary cannot retroactively alter history. A verification layer
re-reads chunks and, for databases, replays them into a throwaway instance to
prove recoverability.

The design decisions that matter are consistency (can a snapshot be applied
correctly?), efficiency (how much storage and bandwidth does history cost?), and
recovery time (how fast can the newest and the oldest backups be restored?).
These three goals pull against each other: full snapshots restore fast but cost
the most; incremental-only backups cost little but chain restores together; and
verification costs resources that protect the one property that actually matters
— the ability to come back from data loss.

### Q2. How do you take consistent snapshots?

Consistency is about producing a snapshot that represents a valid state of the
data as of a single point in time, even though the data is being written
constantly. For databases the problem is sharp: copying tables one by one can
yield a mixture of transactions where row A reflects a later state than row B,
and replaying that combination corrupts the restore. The standard solution is to
coordinate with the database's own consistency machinery, using hot backups on
transactional engines (where the engine exposes a snapshot transaction) or
quiescing writes briefly while files are copied.

A common practical approach is the "copy then apply log" pattern. The backup
engine first records the current log position, then copies the data files, then
notes the log position at copy completion. The backup is the data files plus the
log segment between the two positions, so a restore replays exactly the
transactions that fall in that window. This gives crash-consistency without
stopping writes, and it is why backups of database-backed systems almost always
involve the database's log, not just its files.

For distributed systems, a single consistent snapshot is not enough; the
snapshot must also be ordered across components so a restore does not
reintroduce a read that references a record the backup of another component
dropped. The design handles this with a global snapshot coordination point that
takes the snapshot at a well-defined offset across all volumes, then uses
application-level reconciliation after restore for the remaining skew. Whatever
the mechanism, the snapshot metadata records the exact time and log position,
because that metadata is what makes incremental backup and point-in-time restore
possible later.

### Q3. How do you store backups efficiently?

The two levers for storage efficiency are deduplication and incremental backup,
used together. Deduplication operates at the chunk level: the engine splits
every file into fixed-size or content-defined chunks, hashes each chunk, and
stores only chunks not already present in the store. Chunk-level hashing means a
2 KB edit to a large file costs only the affected chunks, and common data shared
across many machines (an OS image, a shared library) is stored once globally.
Content-defined chunking, where boundaries are derived from the data rather than
fixed offsets, makes deduplication robust to inserts that would shift every
fixed-size chunk.

Incremental backup complements deduplication by never resending what has not
changed. A periodic incremental compares the current snapshot against the last
one, uploads only changed chunks, and records a new manifest that lists the
chunks composing the backup. The manifest is small and cheap to keep; the chunks
are large and stored once. Retention then becomes a manifest-management problem:
deleting an old backup means discarding its manifest and garbage- collecting any
chunks no longer referenced by any remaining manifest, which runs offline to
avoid corrupting the store during active backup.

Storage tiering contains the cost of history. New backups land on fast tiered
storage for quick recovery of recent data, and cold history rolls to cheaper
object or archive tiers according to policy. Compression and encryption are
applied before the chunks leave the backup engine — compression reduces
bandwidth and space, encryption ensures the backup store cannot be read if it is
exfiltrated, and both run before the bytes hit the network so the store never
sees plaintext. The efficiency gains are substantial in practice: with daily
incrementals and monthly fulls, a year of history typically costs a small
multiple of one full backup's size.

### Q4. How do you restore data quickly?

Restore speed is measured two ways: how fast the most recent state can be
recovered, and how fast any historical point can be reached. Recent-state
restore is optimized by keeping the latest full snapshot plus its recent
incrementals in fast storage, and by restoring in parallel — chunk downloads are
fanned out across storage workers, and the engine reassembles files
concurrently. A database restore additionally replays the log segment, which is
deliberately the smallest replayable unit, so the engine downloads chunks,
writes files, and replays the log to land at the exact desired point.

Point-in-time recovery (PITR) is where the snapshot model pays off. Because the
backup engine records the log position of every snapshot, an operator can
request "the database as of 3:14 PM Tuesday", and the restore downloads the
snapshot closest before that time plus the log segments up to the target
timestamp. The engine then replays those segments, then truncates at the target.
PITR converts a backup system from "you get last night" to "you get the state
just before the incident", which is usually the operational goal.

Restore is also a scaling exercise: the first question after a failure is how
many restores can run in parallel without exhausting storage bandwidth or CPU.
The design therefore treats restores as first-class jobs with their own queue,
priority, and progress tracking, and it pre-computes per-job chunk lists so the
heavy planning does not happen during the recovery window. Finally, restore is
tested, not assumed: the verification process described next exercises the
restore path on a schedule, so when the real recovery happens the code path has
already proven itself in production.

### Q5. How do you verify backup integrity?

Verification exists because backups fail silently: the primary looks fine, the
storage looks fine, and the corruption or missing chunk is only discovered at
restore time, when it is too late. The first layer is automated, lightweight
verification on every backup run. After chunks are written, the engine re-reads
a sample and recomputes hashes to detect corrupt or short writes, and each
backup's manifest is checked to confirm every referenced chunk exists in the
store. These checks catch the common causes — partial uploads, silent disk
errors, lost objects.

The second layer is full integrity verification on a schedule. The verifier
walks every manifest, confirms every chunk is present, and recomputes chunk
hashes against the stored hash records. For database backups this runs deeper:
the verifier spins up a throwaway restore of the latest backup into a disposable
instance, replays the log, and runs validation queries (table counts, checksums,
a representative query set) to prove the backup actually produces a working
database. This is the strongest signal the service can emit, because it
exercises the exact restore path with real machinery.

The third layer is the restore drill. Periodic tests restore the oldest retained
backup, a mid-history point, and a PITR target into a sandbox, then report
success or failure per target. If a backup is found corrupt, the pipeline reacts
automatically: it raises an alert, quarantines the corrupt data, and if possible
reconstructs the affected chunks from adjacent snapshots or by re-capturing from
the primary. Every verification result is recorded in the backup catalog, so the
catalog becomes a report card proving the stated retention policy is real — and
it is the first thing an auditor or an operator checks during an incident.

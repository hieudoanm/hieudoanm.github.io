## Answers

### Q1. Design an object storage service

Object storage is a flat, durable key-value store: the key is a bucket plus
object name, and the value is an opaque byte blob with metadata — size, content
type, checksums, timestamps, and access control. The storage API exposes `PUT`,
`GET`, and `DELETE`, authenticating every request against an auth service before
touching data. The architecture splits cleanly into a metadata plane and a data
plane: the metadata DB tracks where each object lives and its attributes, while
a chunk store holds the actual bytes, replicated for durability. An object is
content-addressed by hash, which makes deduplication and integrity checking
straightforward.

Writes are routed by a partitioner that hashes the object key to a partition, so
load distributes across many servers. A placement service decides which servers
hold which chunks, and a replicator copies each chunk to the configured number
of nodes (typically three, or erasure-coded to reduce storage overhead). A
garbage collector reclaims chunks that no live metadata references, and a
monitor tracks disk health, replication lag, and missing replicas to trigger
repair. Reads resolve metadata first, then stream the chunk from the nearest
available copy. The data model — immutable objects, hashed placement, no
in-place updates — is what makes object storage cheap, durable, and trivially
replicated, at the cost of eventual-consistency semantics that callers must be
designed to tolerate. Authentication is orthogonal to the data path: the auth
service issues scoped credentials at the bucket and prefix level, and the API
enforces them before metadata lookup, so authorization cost does not multiply
with object count.

### Q2. How do you scale writes across many servers?

Writes scale by spreading objects across shards and keeping the hot path
parallel. The partitioner hashes the object key (bucket plus name) and maps the
hash to a partition owning a range of hash space; each partition's data lives on
its own set of storage nodes, so aggregate write throughput is roughly
per-partition throughput times the number of partitions. Consistent hashing with
virtual nodes keeps moves small when servers join or leave, and the
partition-to-server assignment lives in the metadata plane, so any stateless API
node can route a request without a global lock. This routing table is the
scaling linchpin: it is small, cached, and versioned, so rebalancing a range is
just a metadata update plus a background data move.

Within a partition, writes are batched and parallelized. Small objects are
buffered and flushed in groups, while large objects are chunked into fixed-size
pieces written concurrently to the replica set. A `PUT` is acknowledged only
after a quorum of replicas confirm, so a single disk failure never loses data.
When a node becomes a hotspot — a popular object or a skew in hash distribution
— the partitioner rebalances ranges, moving the hottest hash ranges to
underloaded nodes, the same machinery that absorbs server failures and new
capacity. The result is a system where write capacity is a function of how many
partitions you run, not a property of any single server. Writes are retryable
and idempotent: the API assigns a request ID, and a retried `PUT` with the same
ID overwrites the previous attempt, so clients can retry safely without creating
duplicate objects.

### Q3. How do you keep metadata consistent and durable?

Metadata is the single source of truth for object existence and location, so it
must be strongly consistent and durable. The metadata DB is a distributed,
replicated, transactional store — a sharded relational database or a
Raft/Paxos-backed KV — sharded by bucket and object-name hash. A `PUT` writes
the chunk replicas first and commits the metadata record last, so a reader can
never see metadata pointing at data that was not yet replicated. The commit is a
transaction that inserts the object row with its checksum and storage location;
if the transaction fails, the replicator's garbage collector eventually removes
the orphaned chunks, keeping the two planes consistent.

Consistency across the data plane is maintained by versioning. Every object
carries a version ID, and reads resolve against the latest committed version. If
a chunk is missing or corrupt at read time, the placement service locates
another replica or rebuilds the chunk from erasure-coded shards, and the monitor
triggers repair to restore the replication factor. The metadata model also
defines the consistency boundary: within a region, reads are strongly consistent
after a successful `PUT`; cross-region reads are eventually consistent because
replication is asynchronous. Buckets can be configured for stronger cross-region
modes at higher latency cost, and the API documents the effective consistency
guarantee so callers know what they can rely on. Metadata durability is
independent of the data plane: even if every chunk copy of an object is lost,
the metadata row persists and triggers repair or an explicit error rather than a
silent 404, keeping failure modes observable.

### Q4. How do you replicate objects across regions?

Replication is layered by distance. Within a region, the replicator writes
chunks to the configured replica set synchronously on the write path — the `PUT`
succeeds only after a quorum of local replicas acknowledges, giving durability
against single-disk and single-node failures. For large objects, erasure coding
(for example, 12-of-16 shards) replaces full copies: any 12 of the 16 shards can
reconstruct the object, cutting storage overhead while keeping the object
available even if several nodes fail. The replicator also runs an async repair
loop that resynchronizes any replica that falls behind or fails a checksum,
converging the cluster back to full replication factor over time.

Cross-region replication is asynchronous and metadata-driven. Each region runs
its own metadata DB; a replication log of object writes streams to remote
regions, which replay the writes against their own chunk stores. Because
replication is asynchronous, the source and destination are briefly inconsistent
— surfaced as replication-lag metrics per bucket rather than hidden. Versioned
buckets make cross-region replication safe: the log carries the version ID, so a
slow replica converges to the latest version without reordering corruption, and
last-write-wins conflicts resolve deterministically by version. Failover works
by promoting a replica region — promote its metadata DB and repoint DNS — so a
region outage degrades availability but never durability, because every object
still exists in multiple regions. Replication follows the metadata write order,
and per-bucket replication filters — such as replicating only certain prefixes —
keep cross-region traffic proportional to what actually needs to move.

### Q5. How do you handle large objects and multipart uploads?

Small objects are written as a single chunk; large objects (gigabytes to
terabytes) are split into fixed-size parts, typically 5–100MB, and uploaded
independently. The API initiates a multipart upload, the client uploads parts in
parallel, and a completion call tells the service to assemble the part list into
an object manifest. The manifest — an ordered list of part references plus
metadata — is what the metadata DB stores, and reads reassemble the object by
streaming the parts in order. This design delivers resumability (a failed part
restarts alone instead of re-uploading the whole object), high bandwidth
(parallel uploads saturate the client's connection), and simplicity in the data
plane (a part is just another chunk).

The chunk store treats every part like a standalone chunk: hashed, replicated,
and garbage-collected if the upload is aborted. Server-side copy, encryption,
and checksum validation operate per part, and a final checksum over the whole
manifest verifies integrity at completion. Reads stream parts sequentially with
bounded read-ahead, and byte-range requests can seek directly to a part
boundary, which is what makes video and large-file serving efficient. Because
objects are immutable, an overwrite simply writes a new manifest and leaves old
chunks to garbage collection — the same mechanism that keeps versioned object
snapshots. The part model extends naturally to large downloads, conditional
reads, and object locking. Multipart concurrency is coordinated through the
manifest: a completion racing an abort is resolved by version check, and
server-side copy of a large object is implemented as a metadata-only operation
that lazily points at the source parts until the first write.

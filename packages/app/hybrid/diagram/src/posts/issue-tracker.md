## Answers

### Q1. Design an issue tracking system

An issue tracker such as Jira organizes software teams around a single artifact:
the issue. Every bug, task, story, or epic is an issue belonging to a project
and passing through a workflow of states such as To Do, In Progress, In Review,
and Done. The system therefore has a small set of core concepts: the Issue
Service owns issue records and their fields, the Project Service links issues to
projects and enforces project-level settings, the Workflow Engine validates
state transitions, and the Sprint Service groups issues into time-boxed
iterations. All of these sit behind a stateless API gateway so the client only
ever talks to one entry point.

The write path is where correctness matters. Creating an issue validates
required fields, enforces permissions, assigns a stable key, and writes to the
Issues DB, a sharded relational store split by project or tenant. Transitions
are guarded by the workflow so an issue cannot move to a state the project does
not allow, and side effects such as reassignment, comment, or notification are
published as events after the transaction commits. Search indexing is driven off
those same events, so the search index is eventually consistent with the
operational store but never blocks the write. This event-driven split is the
backbone of the whole design.

Reads dominate the workload. Boards and backlogs are filtered, sorted views of
potentially thousands of issues, and dashboards aggregate across many projects.
The fast path caches board state and materialized lists, while the search index
powers free-text and JQL-style queries. Realtime collaboration is handled by a
push layer that fans out change events over WebSockets to every client watching
a board or issue, so a transition made by one developer appears on every
teammate's screen in near real time. The result is a system where writes are
transactional and auditable while reads are eventually consistent and fast.

### Q2. How do you model issues, projects, and workflows?

The issue is a rich document on top of a relational core. Every issue has a
stable identifier such as PROJECT-123, a type, a summary, a description, a
reporter, an assignee, and a status; teams then add custom fields such as story
points, sprint, priority, and severity. The Project Service scopes these fields,
because each project defines which issue types and fields are available, and it
owns configuration such as default assignees and templates. A workflow defines
the allowed statuses and the transitions between them, optionally with
conditions, validators, and post-functions that run when a transition fires.
This makes the workflow a small domain-specific state machine executed by the
Workflow Engine.

Modeling choices matter at scale. Storing all fields on one wide row becomes
unwieldy once teams customize heavily, so the canonical design keeps core
columns typed and moves custom fields into an extension table or a JSONB column,
with indexes on the fields teams filter by. Status is stored both as the current
value on the issue and as an append-only history of transitions, so a team can
answer questions like how long an issue spent in review. Sprints are modeled as
a group plus a membership table, because an issue can move between sprints, and
boards are derived projections: a board is just a saved filter over projects,
assignees, and statuses rather than its own storage.

The workflow is versioned. When a team edits a workflow, the engine must keep
old transitions valid for issues already in flight, so each transition record
points to the workflow version that defined it. Approval gates and parallel
statuses complicate the state machine further; some teams run multiple
concurrent states, such as a code-review state and a QA state at once. The
pragmatic answer is to model the workflow as a directed graph with explicit
nodes and edges in a table rather than hard-coded statuses, so arbitrary graphs
can be loaded and validated at runtime without deploying new code.

### Q3. How do you power board and backlog queries?

Boards and backlogs are read-heavy views over issues: a board shows the current
sprint filtered by status columns, while the backlog shows unstarted,
unscheduled issues sorted by priority. Computing these by scanning the issues
table on every request does not scale past a few thousand issues per project.
The pragmatic approach is to maintain materialized projections. A background
worker consumes issue change events and rebuilds board and backlog views into a
projection store, so reading a board is a single keyed lookup rather than a
multi-join query. The projection is keyed by project and sprint, with columns
for the exact statuses and sort orders a board needs.

Queries still need flexibility. Teams filter by assignee, priority, label, epic,
and custom fields, and they expect results in under a hundred milliseconds. Two
complementary engines cover this: an OLTP index for structured filters and a
search index for free text and complex JQL. The structured path can be served
from projections with bitmap-style indexes on filter columns, while anything
touching text, comments, or history goes to the search engine. Keeping both
consistent requires an outbox pattern, where the issue transaction publishes
events that both the projection builder and the search indexer consume; failures
are retried by comparing a cursor of event IDs.

Caching sits in front of both engines. Board definitions and rendered column
layouts are cached by project, and frequently opened backlogs are cached with a
short TTL, invalidated on the next change event for that project. Because a
single issue change can affect many boards, invalidation is coarse: the event
carries the project and sprint keys, and the cache drops every affected entry
rather than trying to diff views precisely. This over-invalidation is cheap
compared with the cost of serving a stale board, and it keeps the projection
builder idempotent and simple to reason about.

### Q4. How do you support real-time collaboration?

Real-time collaboration in an issue tracker means every participant sees changes
without refreshing: a comment appears, a status flips, an assignee changes, a
drag-and-drop reorders the board. The architecture is a publish-subscribe layer
on top of the event stream. When the issue service commits a transaction, it
publishes a domain event describing the change and the affected resources. A
realtime service subscribes to that stream, enriches the event with the payload
needed to render it, and pushes it over WebSockets to every client that
currently has the board or issue open. Clients filter incoming messages by their
subscribed keys, so a client watching board A does not render events for board
B.

Connection management is the scaling problem. Each WebSocket is a long-lived
connection, and a big tenant can have tens of thousands open at once. The
realtime service is therefore stateless for routing, with connection state held
in a shared store and a consistent hash so a client's session is sticky to one
node; a fan-out layer groups connections by subscribed topic so a single event
is not duplicated per connection. Heartbeats, reconnect with sequence-based
catch-up, and delivery receipts guard against flaky mobile connections. On
reconnect, the client fetches the latest state via the API and reconciles it
against the missed push events.

Ordering and conflicts are handled at the source of truth, not the push layer.
Events carry a monotonically increasing sequence, and clients that reconnect
replay missed ranges from the realtime buffer. Drag-and-drop reordering is the
classic race: two people dragging different cards at once. The system resolves
this with optimistic UI plus server-side serialization, where the drag operation
is a transaction that recomputes the order and the losing client receives a
corrected snapshot. This keeps the server authoritative while preserving the
feel of instant, shared interaction.

### Q5. How do you scale search across many issues?

Search in Jira means both free text over summaries and descriptions and
structured JQL over fields like status, assignee, and sprint. Free text is
served by a search engine such as Lucene or Elasticsearch. Documents are the
issues, containing summary, description, comments, and key fields, and they are
indexed incrementally from the change-event stream so indexing never sits on the
write path. Sharding is by project or a range of keys, because almost every
search is scoped to one project or a small set of projects; this keeps queries
within a few shards and makes the index hot for the common case.

Structured queries are a different beast. JQL can join across projects, filter
by custom fields, and combine with boolean logic. Translating JQL to a single
query language is fragile, so the platform translates it into a query plan: the
search engine handles the text portion and facets, while the relational store or
a columnar index handles the structured filters, and the results are
intersected. To keep this fast, documents are enriched with the field values
that filters commonly use, so the search engine itself can satisfy many JQL
filters without hitting the database. Fields the platform does not know about
are handled by a schema registry that maps them to index attributes.

Relevance and freshness pull in opposite directions. Bulk reindexing keeps the
index coherent after migrations, while continuous incremental indexing keeps it
current; the design uses both, with a nightly rebuild for defragmentation and
correction. Per-tenant indexes isolate noisy tenants and let the system size
shards by data volume rather than by global count. Finally, permission filtering
is a major cost: every result must be checked against project and issue-level
permissions before display. The index stores the ACL groups each issue is
visible to, so permission checks become a set intersection during query rather
than a post-query join that would destroy latency.

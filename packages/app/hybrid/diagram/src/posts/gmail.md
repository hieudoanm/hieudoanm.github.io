## Answers

### Q1. Design an email system

An email system splits into a sending path, a receiving path, and a
storage/search layer. Sending: the user composes in the client, the API gateway
accepts the message, the send service persists it and enqueues it for the
delivery agent, which negotiates SMTP with the recipient's MX servers with
retries and backoff. Receiving: an inbound queue accepts messages via SMTP, runs
each through the spam filter, routes it to the correct mailbox, and stores the
message plus its attachments. The mailbox DB holds per-user message metadata and
bodies; a search index provides full-text search; attachment bytes live in a
separate attachment store referenced by ID. Push notifications tell the client
when mail arrives.

Reliability dominates the design because mail must never be lost. Every stage —
inbound queue, outbound queue, indexing — is a durable queue with at-least-once
delivery and idempotent processing, so a crash replays rather than loses a
message. The sending path tracks delivery state per recipient (delivered,
deferred, bounced) and the receiving path honors backoff and RFC-compliant
responses. Users expect near-instant local reads, so the mailbox store is
optimized for append-heavy writes and fast per-user range reads, while search is
eventually consistent — a message is visible in the inbox before its full-text
entry appears. The whole system is multi-tenant at the app level: mailboxes are
isolated per user but stored in shared, horizontally sharded infrastructure to
keep marginal cost per mailbox tiny.

### Q2. How do you store mailboxes so reads and searches stay fast?

The mailbox is modeled as an append-only event log per user: each message
insert/read/delete/flag is a record in a sharded store keyed by (user_id,
mailbox_label), with a monotonic sequence or timestamp per message so the inbox
renders as a range query of the latest N rows. Message bodies are stored
separately (a message store) from the per-user folder rows, so one email sent to
many users is stored once and referenced many times, avoiding duplication of
large blobs. Reads are fast because of locality — all of a user's mail sorts
under a small key range on a small number of shards — and an in-memory cache
serves the most recent few hundred messages per mailbox, which is what the
client's inbox shows. The store is chosen for write throughput and
read-your-writes consistency; relational or log-structured stores both work,
with heavy reliance on index (user, sequence) range scans.

Search is the separate hard path. A full-text index (e.g., an inverted index
built on Lucene-like technology, sharded by user range or hash) indexes subject,
body, and attachment text. Indexing is asynchronous: a worker consumes the
message event log and updates the index, so there is a small lag between
delivery and searchability. Because "all of a user's mail" is the query scope,
the index shards by user, and a search fan-out touches only the user's shards.
The trade-off is index freshness vs write load — indexing every message
immediately is wasteful, so batching is used and monitoring tracks the index
lag. For hot accounts (large mailboxes), the index partitions by time, letting
searches first prune to likely year ranges and fall back to full scans only for
wildcard queries.

### Q3. How do you deliver mail reliably and handle bounces?

Delivery reliability comes from a state machine per recipient. The delivery
agent looks up the recipient's MX records, connects over SMTP, and either
succeeds, defers (temporary failure — the server is busy or greylisting), or
bounces (permanent failure — mailbox doesn't exist, domain is dead). Deferred
mail goes back into a retry queue with exponential backoff and a per-message
deadline (typically several days); each retry records a delivery attempt so
operators can see the delay history. Permanent failures and retry exhaustion
become bounces: the system generates a non-delivery report to the sender,
updates the sender's analytics (delivery rate, bounce rate), and, if the sender
is bulk, throttles or quarantines addresses that bounce consistently to protect
sender reputation. The outbound queue is durable, so a restart mid-flight
resumes exactly where the state machine left off.

Two subtleties matter. First, SMTP is not idempotent — a timeout may mean the
message was delivered or lost — so the delivery agent uses the message ID and
RFC 3834-style semantics to avoid duplicates where possible, and the sender-side
UI shows best-effort status rather than a false "sent" claim. Second, recipient
trust: the sending path must also handle SPF/DKIM/DMARC signing, otherwise
legitimate mail is flagged as spam; the delivery agent attaches signatures
before queuing. Monitoring tracks queue depth, retry counts, and
deferred-to-bounced ratios per recipient domain. Fail-open behavior at the
inbound side (accept mail into a quarantine box rather than reject outright when
the spam filter is down) means the receiving path preserves mail even during
degraded filter performance.

### Q4. How do you detect spam and phishing?

Detection runs on every inbound message before it reaches the mailbox. The spam
filter scores a message along several independent signals: content features
(lexical patterns, URL reputation, image OCR), header and envelope features
(reverse DNS, SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment, sending IP reputation), and behavioral
signals (rate of sending, unusual recipient lists, new-domain patterns). Each
signal produces a probability, and an ensemble (gradient-boosted trees or
logistic regression over the feature vector) combines them into a spam score.
Messages above a hard threshold are rejected or quarantined; borderline messages
go to the spam folder with a link for the user to mark as not spam — and user
feedback is the ground truth that feeds the retraining loop, alongside labeled
honeypot accounts.

Phishing adds content-level and abuse-level defenses on top: URL rewriting that
sandboxes link clicks through a reputation check, known-malware hash matching on
attachments, and brand-impersonation models that catch lookalike domains and
display-name spoofing. Detection must trade false positives against false
negatives — an over-aggressive filter silently eats legitimate mail, so
quarantine rather than delete is the default and per-user sensitivity thresholds
exist. The pipeline is a cascade for cost: cheap, high-precision rules run first
and let most benign mail through without the expensive model, so only the
ambiguous tail hits the heavy classifier. All scores and decisions are logged
for continuous evaluation, and the models are periodically re-trained because
spam adapts within hours.

### Q5. How do you support search across all of a users mail?

Search is served by a per-user full-text index sharded across index servers.
Every delivered message produces an index update (subject, body, sender,
recipients, attachment text after OCR/parsing), and the client's search request
hits the search service, which fan-outs to the shards holding that user's data,
merges ranked results (relevance from BM25-style scoring with recency and folder
weight), and returns message IDs that the mailbox store resolves to full
messages. Queries are expanded server-side — synonyms, typo tolerance, operators
like `from:`, `to:`, `has:attachment` compile into term and filter clauses — and
the index stores not just terms but the fields they appear in, so fielded search
is a filter, not a post-pass.

The hard part is the latency/freshness trade-off. Indexing is asynchronous, so
search lags the inbox by seconds; a user who searches immediately after reading
a just-arrived message sees it in the inbox list but its full-text entry may
still be indexing. Mitigations include a small in-memory postings buffer for the
most recent writes and a search-within-results fallback that also scans recent
message bodies. Because power-law traffic means a few heavy users dominate,
index shards are hot-shard aware: the busiest mailboxes get dedicated index
partitions, and merge/compaction policy is tuned per shard to keep query latency
bounded. Analytics track per-user search latency and index freshness, and when
freshness is poor, the indexer scales out before user-facing search degrades.

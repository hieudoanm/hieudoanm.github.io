## Answers

### Q1. Design a change data capture pipeline

Change data capture (CDC) turns the database's own change stream into a durable,
queryable event log that other systems consume. Instead of a source system
calling out to every consumer after each write, CDC observes the database
directly and publishes inserts, updates, and deletes as ordered events, so
downstream systems (search indexes, caches, analytics warehouses, other
databases) stay in sync without coupling their correctness to the application's
post-write notification logic.

The pipeline has four stages. Capture reads the change stream from the source
database. Publish writes those changes to a durable log such as Kafka, ordered
per key and replays-by-offset. Transform enriches, filters, or re-shapes the
records for specific consumers, often with schema-driven serialization. Apply
delivers to downstream sinks, typically with idempotent semantics so redelivery
is harmless. The diagram in the source block shows exactly this shape: a CDC
agent tails the WAL, a parser decodes changes into a change topic, a transformer
enriches, and sinks apply the result, with a checkpoint store recording consumed
offsets.

The crucial design decision is ordering versus throughput. Change events for a
single row must stay in order or the final state is wrong, so the log keys
events by the row's primary key, which gives per-row ordering at the cost of
losing global order across rows. Most consumers only need per-entity ordering,
so this is the right trade. The pipeline is also a single source of truth for
data movement: consumers never poll the source database, which would add read
load and re-introduce the coupling CDC exists to remove.

### Q2. How do you capture changes from a database?

The reliable mechanism is log-based capture, reading the database's write-ahead
log (WAL) or its replication stream, because the WAL contains every committed
mutation as an ordered sequence that survives crashes. The CDC agent acts as a
replica: it connects to the source as a reader, receives each change record (old
and new row values plus metadata like transaction id), and publishes it to the
change topic. Because the WAL is the database's own durability record, the agent
never misses a committed change even if the application layer is broken — which
is the fundamental advantage over trigger or application-level capture, where
the change is lost if the notifier fails.

Log-based capture does require the database to retain log entries long enough
for the agent to consume them, so retention sizing is part of the design. The
agent maintains a checkpoint — the last published log position — persisted
periodically to a durable store. On startup or crash recovery it resumes from
the checkpoint, not from zero, so a restart re-processes only the small window
of changes after the last checkpoint. Checkpointing frequency trades durability
against overhead: checkpoints that are too frequent add write load, while rare
checkpoints lengthen the re-scan on recovery.

Alternatives exist but are weaker. Polling a change timestamp column only
catches inserts and updates that set the column, misses deletes, and is
non-deterministic under concurrent writes. Triggers add per-write latency and
store into a side table that can be inconsistent with the main table under a
crash. Both are reasonable only when the source cannot expose a WAL. The
practice is to prefer WAL capture, validate it with a periodic reconciliation
job, and design consumers to tolerate duplicates and out-of-order arrival
anyway, because redelivery is inherent to distributed delivery.

### Q3. How do you keep downstream systems consistent?

Consistency across systems is achieved by making the change log the ordering
authority and by making every consumer idempotent. Each change event carries a
primary key and a version (the source's update timestamp or an ever-increasing
log offset). Consumers apply changes in offset order per key and ignore any
event with a version not newer than what they already hold, so even if the same
change is delivered twice, or a stale event arrives late, the sink converges to
the latest value. This "last write wins with version check" discipline turns
eventual consistency into a bounded, self-healing property.

A second lever is atomic publication plus outbox pattern on the source side. If
the application must guarantee that a business operation and its change event
both happen or neither happens, the source writes to a transactionally
consistent outbox table in the same transaction as the business data. CDC then
captures the outbox — the log of the same commit — so consumers see an event for
every committed operation with exactly-once-per-commit semantics at the source.
This removes the classic race where an external notification happens even though
the transaction rolled back.

The sink must define its consistency target. A search index or cache usually
needs at-most-minutes staleness and can apply idempotent upserts. An analytics
warehouse wants at-least-once with deduplication on load. A second database in
the same region can accept near-real-time lag but needs ordering preserved. The
pipeline makes each consumer's job easier by emitting full row snapshots on
updates rather than deltas, so a consumer can apply an update without joining
against the old value. Health is monitored by tracking the lag between the last
published offset and the last applied offset per sink, alerting when lag grows
beyond its budget.

### Q4. How do you handle schema changes?

Schema changes are the highest-risk event in a CDC pipeline because source and
consumer can disagree about the shape of a record. The discipline is
compatibility: every published change event is versioned, and the version
describes the schema it conforms to. The pipeline holds a schema registry that
maps version numbers to schemas and enforces evolution rules — adding an
optional field is safe, renaming or changing a field's type is a breaking change
that requires coordinated rollout. Consumers read the version and decode
accordingly, and the registry keeps every historical version so replay works
even after the current schema has moved on.

The pipeline handles schema evolution by decoupling source change from consumer
change. The capture layer must be tolerant of additive changes: a new column
appears in the WAL, and the parser emits records with the new field without
breaking consumers that ignore unknown fields. A removed column is handled by
backfilling a default during a transition window. The transform layer can absorb
breaking changes for consumers that have not migrated by maintaining a
compatibility projection — serving the old shape until all consumers upgrade —
which lets the source migrate independently of consumers.

Breaking changes need an explicit, ordered rollout rather than hope. The
sequence is: register the new schema version, release the consumer to accept
both old and new, run the source migration, then drop the old version. Because
events are versioned and the registry is durable, a consumer that missed the
transition can still decode historical records. The registry also doubles as
documentation and drift detection: a diff between the source's declared schema
and the registry's recorded version flags unexpected writes before they poison
downstream systems.

### Q5. How do you replay from a point in time?

Replay is the property that makes CDC a safety net rather than just a feed. It
rests on the change topic being durable and offset-addressed: every event has a
stable log position and the topic retains data for a retention window, so a
consumer can re-read from any position in that window. Replay means starting a
consumer at a chosen offset and processing forward from there, which is exactly
how a new consumer bootstraps without requiring the source database to hold
state for it.

Bootstrap-to-replay is the key pattern. A consumer that starts from scratch
first loads a consistent snapshot of the source, then applies all changes after
the snapshot's point-in-time. The pipeline supports this by making snapshots
point-in-time consistent: the snapshot captures a position (a log offset or a
transaction id), the consumer loads the snapshot, then replays the log from that
position forward, merging to the current state. Storing a table of
snapshot-to-offset mappings lets any consumer be rebuilt at any historical point
within the retention window. For repairs, replay into a broken sink happens on
the same idempotent path used for live delivery, so the sink converges instead
of corrupting.

Replay is also the mechanism for correctness fixes. When a transformer had a bug
that mis-shaped events for a period, operators fix the transformer and re-run
that offset range into the affected sink. The WAL reader itself replays from its
checkpoint after a crash, which is a bounded, automatic replay of the un-acked
window. Boundaries come from storage economics: deep replay requires retention,
and retention costs money, so the pipeline tiers replay depth — minutes of hot
in-memory retention for rapid debugging, days or weeks of durable retention on
tiered storage for full rebuilds, and snapshot-based bootstrap beyond the
retention window.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a multiplayer online game backend

A multiplayer game backend is a real-time simulation shared across many players,
where the server is the source of truth. Players send inputs from the Game
Client through a Gateway, which routes each player to a Session Service that
owns their connection and their place in the world. A Tick Loop advances the
simulation on a fixed schedule, mutating the authoritative Game State, and a
State Sync layer diffs the state and sends updates back to the clients. The
world is split into World Shards so different zones run on different processes.
A separate Chat Service carries player messages, and a Snapshot Service
periodically checkpoints the world to the Game DB so the game can survive a
crash.

The two performance-critical paths are the input path and the state path. Inputs
must reach the simulation fast and be processed in order, because the simulation
result depends on the exact sequence of actions. State updates must be
minimized, because broadcasting the entire world state every tick would saturate
the network; instead, only the deltas since the last acknowledged update are
sent. These two constraints, ordered inputs in, minimal diffs out, define the
shape of the whole system.

The backend trades off three goals that cannot all be maximized: latency,
consistency, and throughput. Lowering latency favors running simulation close to
players and sending frequent updates. Consistency favors a single authoritative
source that makes everyone agree. Throughput favors sharding and parallelism
that can conflict with consistency. The design makes an explicit choice: the
server is authoritative, consistency is relaxed through client prediction and
interpolation, and sharding is done by world zone so that consistency within a
zone is preserved.

### Q2. How do you synchronize game state at 60fps?

Synchronization at high frequency is impossible if the server sends complete
state every tick, so the design minimizes both what is sent and how often. The
Tick Loop runs the simulation at a fixed rate, and the State Sync layer computes
the delta between the previous snapshot and the current one: only entities that
changed, only their changed fields, with coordinates quantized to reduce size.
The server also adapts the send rate to the client, dropping or batching updates
for players who cannot consume them, so a player on a slow connection is not
flooded with updates they will discard.

Deltas must be expressed against a shared baseline or they become meaningless.
Each update references the previous snapshot the client acknowledged, so the
client can always compute the current state from its last known state plus the
deltas. This requires the server to retain a short history of snapshots per
client, so a lost update can be repaired by resending from an acknowledged point
rather than restarting synchronization. Position is interpolated between
received snapshots, so the rendered world moves smoothly even though updates
arrive in discrete packets.

The pipeline is designed for bounded bandwidth regardless of player count.
Rather than per-player full state, the server sends each client the entities it
can see, based on relevance and interest management, which limits updates to the
local neighborhood. Aggregating many small updates into fewer, larger packets
improves throughput on the wire, and compression is applied to the packets. The
synchronization layer is also the place where security boundaries are drawn:
clients never send state directly, they only send inputs, and every state change
originates from the simulation.

### Q3. How do you run the authoritative tick loop?

The Tick Loop is the heartbeat of the simulation, advancing the world on a fixed
timestep, typically 10 to 30 ticks per second. The Session Service delivers each
player's buffered inputs to the tick, and the simulation applies them
deterministically in the order they were received, mutating the Game State. A
fixed timestep is essential: the simulation must produce the same result given
the same inputs, so all players see a consistent world even if their frames
arrive at irregular intervals. The loop catches up or slows down rather than
tying simulation time to wall-clock jitter.

Determinism is the property that makes the loop trustworthy. The tick step is a
pure function of the previous state and the input batch, with no floating-point
ambiguity that would let two replicas diverge. This is what allows World Shards
to run in parallel, because each shard's simulation is independent given its
inputs, and what allows a crash-restarted shard to reconstruct a consistent
state from checkpoints and the replayable input log. The Game State is held in
memory, in a structure designed for fast mutation and fast diffing rather than
for database-shaped queries.

The tick loop is also the reliability boundary. If the loop runs slow, the game
slows down for everyone on that shard, so the loop is monitored for tick
duration and the workload is kept light enough to always complete within the
budget. Snapshot Service checkpoints run out of band, capturing the state
without pausing the loop, so persistence never stalls the simulation. Because
the loop is the single writer of authoritative state, every other system, sync,
snapshots, and analytics, reads from it rather than competing for writes.

### Q4. How do you handle lag and prediction?

Lag is the gap between a player acting and the result appearing, and the design
attacks it with client-side prediction and reconciliation. When the player
issues an input, the client applies it immediately to a local prediction of the
world, so their own character responds instantly instead of waiting a round
trip. When the authoritative server state arrives, the client compares it with
its prediction, and if they differ, it rewinds to the last confirmed state and
replays the intervening inputs. This is called reconciliation, and it keeps the
player's view responsive while the server remains the final authority.

For the rest of the world, the client uses interpolation between the two most
recent server snapshots. Remote entities are always slightly behind the server
because their state arrives after the fact, but interpolation renders them
moving smoothly rather than jumping. The two techniques, prediction for the
player's own avatar and interpolation for everything else, work together: own
action feels instant, remote action feels smooth, and neither requires the
client to trust its own view over the server.

Latency compensation is a server-side counterpart to prediction. When a player
shoots at a target, the server evaluates the shot against the world as it
appeared at the player's client time, not the current server time. This prevents
players with higher latency from being systematically disadvantaged, at the cost
of occasionally allowing hits that are not exactly current. The combination,
prediction on the client, interpolation of remote entities, and lag compensation
on the server, is what makes a high-latency game still feel fair and responsive.

### Q5. How do you scale players across servers?

Scaling comes from sharding the world rather than from making one process
bigger. The World Shards partition the game world into zones, and each shard
runs its own Tick Loop and owns its own slice of Game State on one process.
Players are assigned to the shard that owns their current location, and the
Gateway routes them there. The benefit is that player capacity scales with the
number of shard processes, and the cost is that interactions across shard
boundaries must be mediated, which is why sharding is typically by zone or by
match instance, keeping the simulation boundaries aligned with gameplay
boundaries.

Two coordination problems dominate the design. The first is moving players
between shards, either by traveling between zones or by load rebalancing. A
transfer freezes the player's state briefly, migrates it to the target shard,
and reconnects the player with a synchronized snapshot, so the player
experiences a moment of handoff rather than a reset. The second is global
services that every player touches, such as matchmaking, chat, and persistence,
which are separated into their own tiers and scale independently of the
simulation.

The system must also handle uneven population and hardware failure. A shard that
is overloaded, for example a popular zone, can be split into two zones or the
world can be dynamically rebalanced, moving entities and players to underused
shards. When a shard process dies, players must be reconnected and the shard
restored from its latest checkpoint plus the input log, so the design keeps
input logging and checkpointing cheap enough to be continuous. Capacity planning
is done per shard with a known ceiling, and the Gateway backs off new joins when
a shard approaches its limit rather than letting it fail under load.

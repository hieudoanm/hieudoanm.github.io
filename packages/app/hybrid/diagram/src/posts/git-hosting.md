# Git Hosting — Repositories

Object storage, refs, pull requests, CI, code review.

## Interview Questions

- Design a git hosting service
- How do you store git objects at scale?
- How do you make clone and fetch operations fast?
- How do you run CI on pushed commits?
- How do you handle large repositories and monorepos?

## Answers

### Q1. Design a git hosting service

The service terminates git protocol traffic (smart HTTP, SSH) at a Git Gateway,
which authenticates the developer, resolves the repository, and runs the
receive-pack or upload-pack conversation against the Repo Service. A push
accepts the packfile, writes the referenced objects into the Object Store, and
updates the refs (branches, tags) through the Ref Service in a fast-forward-
checked transaction — ref updates are atomic per repository. The Web UI lets
developers open a PR, which the PR Service creates with a head/base pair, runs
review workflows, and reports CI status; Notifications fan out comments,
reviews, and status changes. Object storage is content-addressed by SHA-1/SHA-
256, so identical blobs and trees are deduplicated across the whole platform;
refs are the only mutable state. Read paths dominate, so clones are served from
hot caches and packfile caches, while writes land in durable blob storage.
Failure handling covers interrupted pushes (orphaned objects are
garbage-collected), concurrent ref updates (atomic compare-and-swap), and CI
outages (status is reported asynchronously via webhooks rather than blocking the
push).

### Q2. How do you store git objects at scale?

Git objects are stored content-addressed in an Object Store partitioned by the
first two hex characters of the object hash, which spreads writes across shards
while keeping lookups local to a bucket. Loose objects are written on push and
later batched into packfiles by a background job to reduce the object count and
compress deltas; the store is write-once and immutable, so a shared packfile
cache serves identical content to many clones. Every object has a reference
count derived from reachability — refs plus the PR data referencing commits —
and a garbage collector removes objects unreachable from any ref after a grace
period, with atomic reachability sweeps. Duplicate pushes are cheap because a
re-pushed commit whose objects already exist only writes the new ref. To bound
cost, large blobs are stored as a single object (with optional LFS offloading)
and storage tiers move cold repositories to cheaper media. Integrity is verified
with periodic object-hash re-checks and repair-from-replica, because a corrupted
object in a content-addressed store is silently dangerous to every downstream
clone.

### Q3. How do you make clone and fetch operations fast?

Clone speed is dominated by packfile construction, so the service caches
precomputed packs per repository and serves the delta-compressed pack rather
than re-building it per request. The gateway runs the negotiation protocol
(e.g., fetch negotiation with `have`/`want`) to send only missing objects, and
the server generates a thin pack of just those objects when a precomputed pack
does not match. Repositories with long history benefit from bitmap indexes in
packfiles, which answer reachability questions (which objects does a ref
actually need) without walking the graph. Hot repositories are pinned on fast
local disks with an in-memory object cache, while cold repositories are served
from the archive tier; a repository moves tiers on access patterns. Partial
clone and blobless clone are advertised for huge repositories so developers
fetch only what they need, and shallow clones cap the history transferred for CI
and one-off fetches. The gateway runs on many instances behind the repository
sharding (repo → shard mapping in a registry), so clone load spreads
horizontally and a hot repo does not collapse a single machine.

### Q4. How do you run CI on pushed commits?

When a push updates a ref, the gateway publishes a push event containing the new
commit sha and the repo to a CI event stream; CI runs are triggered per event,
never polled. The CI runner schedules jobs on a worker pool, clones the commit
(with a cache of dependencies and build artifacts keyed by repo + commit graph),
executes the pipeline, and reports status back to the PR Service and to commit
status APIs. Deduplication prevents redundant work: identical commit shas or
identical (repo, tree) combinations reuse cached results, and "cancelled
superceded" semantics stop a slow job when a newer push lands on the same
branch. Runners are isolated per job — container or VM — so untrusted pipeline
code cannot affect other tenants, with resource quotas on CPU, memory, and
network. Results are written to a status store and pushed via webhooks to the PR
UI in real time; logs stream to an object-backed log store that supports
tailing. Failures are handled with retries for transient errors and a clear fail
status for genuine test failures, and the event stream replays missed events so
a runner crash never silently drops a CI run.

### Q5. How do you handle large repositories and monorepos?

Large repositories and monorepos strain clone times, CI, and ref lookups, so the
platform shifts cost out of the naive path. Blobless and tree-less partial
clones let developers clone metadata and fetch objects on demand, which turns a
multi-GB monorepo clone into a small metadata fetch. CI for a monorepo uses
change detection: a diff between the base and head commit identifies which
projects actually changed, and the scheduler builds and tests only affected
projects, with a no-change fast path that reports success immediately. Pack
serving uses a sharded object cache per repository and path-filtered packfiles
so a checkout only materializes the subdirectories a job needs. Ref lookups and
reachability use a commit-graph cache (generation numbers) to avoid walking
entire histories. Scaling concerns include oversized single blobs (mitigated by
LFS and size limits) and many refs (ref advertisements are paginated and
cached). Governance tooling — path-based code owners, required status checks per
subtree — becomes necessary, and the service optimizes for the monorepo's
wide-fanout PR traffic by caching PR base snapshots.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a hotel booking platform

A hotel booking platform is best decomposed into small, horizontally scalable
services behind an API gateway, each owning its data. The search service keeps a
denormalized index of hotels, room types, amenities, and prices so guests can
filter and rank results quickly. The availability engine owns inventory and
tracks supply by property, room type, and date range. The booking service
orchestrates reservation state machines, and the payment service owns charging,
refunds, and currency conversion. A relational Bookings DB stores reservations,
a search cache backs hot read paths, and a room inventory store guards supply.

The primary flow starts when a guest searches through the app. The gateway
routes the query to search, which reads its cache, then asks the availability
engine to confirm open dates, and returns ranked results. When the guest
proceeds to book, the booking service locks inventory for the requested nights,
triggers a charge through payment, persists the reservation, and publishes a
confirmation event that the notification service consumes. Cancellations,
no-shows, and price changes flow through the same state machine, releasing locks
and issuing refunds. Booking is modeled as an idempotent workflow with explicit
states (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed), so retries and partial
failures never create duplicate reservations.

I would connect services with an event bus so availability changes,
confirmations, and cancellations propagate asynchronously to search, cache, and
notification workers. This keeps the synchronous path short while enabling
price-drop alerts and inventory reconciliation. The main tradeoff is eventual
consistency: search may briefly show stale availability, which is acceptable
because the availability engine revalidates the instant a guest commits to
booking. Sharded databases and read replicas absorb read-heavy search traffic,
while a short-lived inventory lock prevents two guests from claiming the same
night.

### Q2. How do you prevent double-booking and overbooking?

Double-booking happens when two reservations claim the same room-night, while
overbooking is a deliberate policy of selling more inventory than exists to
hedge against cancellations and no-shows. I would prevent double-booking at the
source with a pessimistic lock: before confirming, the availability engine
atomically decrements capacity for every requested night in a single transaction
against the inventory store. Because the decrement is conditional on remaining
capacity being positive, the second concurrent request for the same night fails
instead of silently succeeding.

For low-latency booking flows, I would use a conditional UPDATE on the inventory
row (update capacity where capacity is greater than zero) or a Redis-based lock
on the room-night key, and fall back to the database for final authority. The
lock is short-lived and released after the reservation is committed, so hot
dates do not serialize the whole system. Idempotency keys on booking requests
prevent a client retry from decrementing inventory twice; the engine returns a
booking id and dedupes repeats by key before touching inventory. Overbooking is
then a tuned oversell factor applied to specific room types and dates, kept
below a threshold derived from historical no-show rates.

Because cancellations are common, an overbooking policy must be coupled to an
overflow strategy: when oversold inventory is realized, the platform procures a
comparable alternative room or comps the guest. I would monitor the realized
no-show rate against the model continuously and adjust the oversell factor,
because overbooking that exceeds real no-shows produces angry guests and
compensation costs. The ledger of locks, releases, and overflow events also
feeds analytics that fine-tune the policy over time. Credit-card-backed
reservations reduce no-shows at premium tables and give the platform a recovery
mechanism, layered on top of the base policy.

### Q3. How do you design search and filtering for millions of rooms?

Search over millions of rooms is a read-heavy pattern that suits an inverted
index over denormalized documents. Each hotel document stores city,
neighborhood, star rating, price band, amenity flags, and room inventory for the
next rolling horizon. I would index these in Elasticsearch for free-text and geo
queries, while the availability engine provides a compact summary of open date
ranges used for coarse pre-filtering. Typical filters (city, dates, guests,
star, price) are structured fields, so most searches are filtered term lookups
over a few hundred thousand hotels plus a room-type expansion.

To keep latency bounded, I would add a caching tier between the gateway and the
index. Popular city-plus-date combos are cached with a short TTL, so a spike
like a holiday weekend hits the cache rather than the cluster. Query results
include facets computed at index time, letting the UI offer filters for price,
rating, and amenities without recomputing counts per request. For personalized
results, a user context service injects signals like past city, price
preference, and loyalty tier into the query. Because inventory changes
constantly, the cache TTL and the availability re-check reconcile freshness with
cost.

At this scale I would shard the index by region or city cluster so a typical
query touches a small number of shards, and run read replicas sized for peak
browsing load. Ranking combines editorial signals like relevance, rating, price,
and partner bid, computed by a lightweight model over the cached facets. Compact
binary summaries of open slots are embedded in the cached facets so search can
pre-filter bookable hotels before hitting the index. Scaling out is mostly
adding replicas and cache nodes; the hot-path query shape stays simple, which
keeps p99 latency in the tens of milliseconds. The tradeoff is between index
freshness and query cost; daily reindex plus near-real-time updates keeps search
accurate enough for a booking flow.

### Q4. How do you handle payments, refunds, and currency conversion?

Payments must be idempotent, auditable, and resilient to provider outages, so I
would isolate them in a dedicated payment service that talks to one or more
acquiring partners. Every charge or refund is keyed by a unique idempotency key
generated when the booking is created, so retries after timeouts never
double-charge. The payment service persists the transaction lifecycle
(authorized, captured, refunded, failed) and reconciles against provider
settlement reports asynchronously, because bank-side state is authoritative and
can diverge from ours. A webhook to the booking service flips reservation state
on authorization success rather than trusting the client.

Currency conversion is handled at authorization time using an exchange-rate
service that snapshots rates per currency pair with a timestamp. I would store
the rate applied on the transaction record so the price shown to the guest is
exactly the price charged, and use conservative rounding that pushes any
remainder to a merchant margin rather than a surprise for the guest.
Multi-currency pricing is cached and refreshed periodically; live fluctuations
between cache refreshes are absorbed within a small tolerance.

Refunds flow through the same state machine in reverse: a cancellation event
triggers a refund calculation that respects the hotel's cancellation policy and
fees, then issues a reverse transaction against the original capture. Failure
handling matters because refunds can fail after a cancellation is confirmed; a
durable retry queue replays them until success, and a dead-letter queue surfaces
persistent failures to ops. Compliance is preserved by keeping every money
movement in an append-only ledger and hashing the whole chain for audits. The
same ledger feeds currency exposure reporting, so finance sees gross exposure
per currency daily.

### Q5. How do you handle cancellations and pricing changes?

Cancellations are state transitions on a reservation that must release inventory
and settle money in the right order. When a guest cancels, the booking service
computes the refund amount from the cancellation policy of the rate plan,
releases the locked room-nights back to the availability engine, issues the
refund through payment, and emits a cancellation event that search consumes to
refresh availability. I would make this a saga: release inventory first if the
policy is non-refundable, otherwise issue the refund before releasing, and
compensate with a re-lock and re-charge if a downstream step fails.

Pricing changes arrive from revenue management as new rate plans or dynamic
per-night prices. I model prices as per-date room rates stored in the inventory
record rather than a single scalar on the room type, so a booking spanning
several nights composes per-night prices. Because an in-progress booking must be
quoted consistently, the availability engine snapshots the price quote at
reservation time and binds it; changes after that only affect new bookings, and
re-quotes are explicit user actions.

In-flight changes such as a guest modifying dates are implemented as cancel plus
rebook inside a single transaction to avoid double-holding inventory. Rate plans
support advance-purchase discounts and refund windows, and the cancellation
policy lookup is versioned so historical reservations keep the policy they
booked under. Surge pricing on high-demand nights and last-minute discounts both
flow through the per-date model, so the search cache reflects the latest
effective price. Notifications keep the guest informed at each transition, and
reconciliation jobs compare issued refunds against policy expectations nightly,
catching drift early before it becomes a dispute.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a grocery delivery service

A grocery delivery service is a marketplace that combines an e-commerce catalog
with a logistics problem: picking items from physical stores and delivering them
within a promised window. I would structure it as an API gateway in front of
domain services (catalog, cart, order, inventory sync, shopper matching,
delivery routing) backed by an Orders DB and a notification service. I would
also keep menu and per-store pricing separate so a chain with regional pricing
can serve one catalog across many stores. The catalog is read-heavy and cached;
the cart is a short-lived session store; orders own the state machine from
placed to delivered.

The checkout flow calls the order service, which validates stock through the
inventory sync layer, assigns a shopper, plans a route, and charges payment
before persisting. Because stores run independent point-of-sale systems,
inventory is a sync problem rather than a single database: per-store counts
stream in from store systems and are reconciled continuously, with conservative
safety buffers so an order never asks a shopper to pick items that are not
actually on the shelf.

The hard scaling questions are geographic: order volume concentrates in dense
urban zones during evening windows. Sharding the Orders DB by region and routing
requests by store zone keeps hot data local. The design deliberately separates
synchronous order capture from asynchronous fulfillment so a checkout never
waits on route planning or shopper assignment, and notifications push status
changes to the customer. Metrics that matter are order-to-door time,
substitution rate, and shopper utilization; a metrics pipeline feeds capacity
planning and the dynamic fees shown at checkout.

### Q2. How do you match shoppers with orders at scale?

Shopper matching is an assignment problem: pair each pending order with an
available shopper who is physically near the store, has the right vehicle
capacity, and is on duty. I would model it as a two-phase system. A coordination
layer maintains a live registry of online shoppers with their current GPS
location, state, and active-order count. When an order is ready for assignment,
a matcher evaluates candidate shoppers within a radius, ranks them by distance,
utilization, and estimated readiness, and assigns the winner.

At scale, a single global matcher becomes a bottleneck, so I would shard by
store or fulfillment zone. Each zone runs its own matcher with a local view,
reducing contention and keeping decisions geographically local. Pending orders
wait in a zone-level queue, and shoppers report availability through a mobile
app; a short reservation on the shopper prevents the same shopper from being
assigned two orders simultaneously. The matcher also respects shopper
preferences like distance caps and batch limits, and re-pushes orders that were
not claimed within a timeout.

Assignment is only a first cut; routes and times update as shoppers move. When a
shopper finishes a delivery, the system reassigns from the zone queue, so
high-demand windows stay balanced. The tradeoff is optimality versus latency: a
greedy local match delivers in milliseconds while a global optimizer might save
minutes per route but cannot keep up with live movement. I would start greedy,
measure utilization and wait times, and only add optimization heuristics where
they clearly reduce delivery cost. Notifications to the shopper include the
store, item count, and window, with an explicit accept or reject path.

### Q3. How do you keep inventory in sync across stores?

Stores do not share one inventory system, so sync is the hard part. Each store
pushes counts from its point-of-sale and shelf systems to the inventory sync
layer through a CDC pipeline or periodic batch uploads. I would model inventory
as per-store, per-item on-hand counts with an event stream, and maintain both a
transactional snapshot for order validation and a read model for the catalog UI
that shows in-stock badges per store. The event stream is also the source for
analytics like best sellers per store and for predicting demand, which feeds
automated replenishment suggestions back to store managers.

Because store feeds are noisy and lag behind reality, I would add safety
buffers: the system treats reported on-hand counts as an upper bound and applies
a small shrinkage factor, and an order only commits stock with a soft
reservation that the shopper confirms by scanning the item in the store.
Reconciliation jobs compare order captures, returns, and waste against the store
feed nightly, adjusting buffers where drift is persistent. Item substitutions
during picking update the snapshot in the same flow, so the customer's final
receipt always reflects what was actually bagged.

The tradeoff is freshness versus correctness. Live sync gives better conversion,
but store systems fail; I would degrade gracefully by marking a store's items as
lower confidence and hiding low-stock items rather than overselling. Cross-store
transfers, delisted items, and price changes all flow through the same event
stream so the catalog, cart, and order services stay consistent without a shared
database. Inventory events are idempotent and keyed by item and store, so
replays from a temporarily offline feed do not corrupt counts.

### Q4. How do you handle delivery time windows and routing?

Time windows are a promise that must be jointly feasible for the store, the
shopper, and the route. At order time, the system computes available windows
from store capacity, current shopper availability, and zone load, then returns
the earliest feasible slot. I would model windows as capacity units: each
store-zone pair has a number of delivery slots per window, decremented on
reservation and released on cancellation, which prevents overselling the promise
while shoppers can still batch deliveries. Fees vary by window and zone, which
naturally shapes demand toward off-peak slots and makes the scheduling model
self-balancing.

Routing is a vehicle routing problem with time windows solved by the delivery
routing service. For a small fleet per zone I would use an exact or heuristic
solver that sequences stops by due time and travel time; as zones scale,
cluster-first, route-second keeps solver time bounded. Live GPS positions feed
the router so delays on one stop automatically re-optimize the remaining stops
rather than blindly following the original plan. Travel time estimates come from
historical map data rather than live traffic alone, so plan times are stable
even when current conditions are noisy.

Because routing decisions happen after checkout, the system only needs soft
constraints at booking time. I would keep route planning asynchronous, then
expose the customer's live position and ETA through notifications. The key
failure case is traffic or a missing item late in the route; the router
re-plans, and the notification service explains the delay honestly, since a
credible ETA matters more than a perfect route. Each store also caps concurrent
shoppers to avoid crowding the aisles.

### Q5. How do you handle order substitutions and refunds?

Substitutions are the defining edge case of grocery delivery: the shopper cannot
find an item and must decide whether to swap it or refund it. I would encode
per-item substitution preferences chosen by the customer (allow similar, allow
any, or refund only) and let the shopper app make the decision against the live
inventory snapshot. The shopper scans the replacement barcode, and the order
service revalidates the price difference against the customer's saved payment
method. Real-time availability inside the store comes from the shopper's own
scan events, which is more accurate than any forecast, so the app blocks
impossible choices before they are presented.

Refunds for missing or substituted items flow through the payment service as a
partial refund keyed by the original order, with the reason recorded for
analytics. I would apply refunds automatically for refund-only items and require
a one-tap confirmation for substitutions that change price materially. Because
refunds are post-delivery, the order service must track line-level state, so the
snapshot model keeps every item's planned and actual identity, quantity, and
price. No-show shoppers and order abandonments also release reserved stock
through the same line-level state machine.

The system should also learn from substitution patterns: repeat stock-outs of an
item across stores raise it in the replenishment feed, and items frequently
substituted downward get demoted in the catalog to avoid disappointing
customers. A nightly reconciliation ensures that every delivered line has either
a matching charge or a refund, and any mismatch is flagged to a finance queue.
Notifications keep the customer informed during the swap decision window, so
nothing silently changes on the receipt. This keeps the trust layer of the
product (accurate receipts) intact at scale.

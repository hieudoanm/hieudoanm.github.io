## Answers

### Q1. Design a weather service

A weather service takes raw forecast data from meteorology providers and turns
it into timely, accurate forecasts for arbitrary locations. The core pipeline
has three phases. First, the Ingest Worker pulls model output and observation
feeds from providers such as national weather agencies and commercial forecast
vendors. Second, the Forecast Service organizes that data by geographic grid
point and serves a single normalized forecast format to clients. Third, the
Alert Engine watches the incoming data for conditions that exceed severe weather
thresholds and dispatches push notifications. The Geocoding component maps a
free-text location into coordinates, and the Weather DB stores the ingested
forecast grid plus historical observations.

The design is dominated by a small number of large facts. Forecast data is
produced on a fixed cadence, usually hourly, and applies to a global grid of
tens of millions of points, which means ingest is a heavy batch workload while
reads are tiny per user. The product therefore separates the write path, which
is throughput bound, from the read path, which is latency bound. The Forecast
Cache sits between them and serves the vast majority of requests without
touching the database. The architecture also treats providers as pluggable
sources, because contract differences, units, and refresh schedules vary, so an
adapter layer normalizes each source into one internal schema.

The interesting engineering tension is freshness versus accuracy. Weather
deteriorates with age, so forecasts are refreshed aggressively, yet the
underlying model output is only recomputed by the provider at set intervals. The
service must merge partial updates, reconcile conflicting provider readings with
a blending strategy such as weighted averaging, and keep enough history to
detect model bias. Availability matters as much as any consumer service, since
users check weather exactly when the weather is worst, so the read path is
replicated and the alert path has its own redundancy rather than sharing the
forecast database.

### Q2. How do you ingest data from multiple forecast providers?

Ingestion is a scheduled batch pipeline rather than a request-driven one. Each
provider exposes a feed in its own format, from binary GRIB model output to JSON
and XML forecasts, so a provider adapter converts everything into a common
internal schema with standardized units, coordinate system, and timestamps. The
Ingest Worker runs on a cron cadence that matches the provider's publish
schedule, fetches only the changed slices, and writes new records into the
Weather DB. Fetch failures are retried with backoff, and a stuck provider
triggers an alert so operators know the data is stale rather than silently
serving old forecasts.

Reconciliation is the subtle part. Providers do not agree perfectly: two models
may give different temperatures for the same point, and a single provider may
revise its own output between runs. The ingest layer stamps each record with
provider, model run time, and ingestion time, and the forecast assembly step
decides which value wins. A common approach is to blend model output with recent
observations, downweighting sources with historically high error for that
region. Every input is kept immutable in the database so the blend can be
recomputed later if a provider's quality changes or a bug is fixed.

The pipeline must also throttle itself. Pulling a full global grid every hour is
a large transfer, so ingest fetches deltas, only areas the provider marks as
updated, and applies backpressure by scheduling the largest downloads outside
peak hours. Payloads are compressed and checksummed to catch corruption in
transit. Because correctness compounds, a bad batch can poison forecasts for
hours, so an ingestion integrity check compares the incoming data against
plausible bounds and rejects outliers before they reach the serving path.

### Q3. How do you serve forecasts by location at scale?

Serving starts with the Geocoding lookup, which resolves a request to latitude
and longitude, then snaps that point to the nearest grid cell in the forecast
model. The Forecast Service reads the cell's data and formats it as the public
response, with current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, and derived
values such as feels-like temperature. This is deliberately cheap per request,
so the bottleneck is the cache, not the database. The Forecast Cache keys on
grid cell plus model run, and the vast majority of users hit the same hot cells,
so cache hit rates are extremely high and the read path stays in microseconds.

The scaling trick is geographic partitioning. The global grid is sharded by
region, so a lookup for a point in Japan never touches servers storing North
American cells. Each shard owns a contiguous block of cells, which also makes
ingest writes local and predictable. Cell-level granularity has a precision
tradeoff: a grid point may be kilometers away from the actual location in
mountainous or coastal terrain. The service addresses this with an interpolation
pass, blending neighboring cells by distance, and stores per-cell derived
statistics that are expensive to compute but cheap to reuse, such as sunrise,
sunset, and daily high and low.

The serving layer handles spikes through the same patterns as any read-heavy
system. The cache is replicated and geographically distributed so a weather
event in one region does not overload a single cache. When a forecast grid
updates, the cache is invalidated per cell in a controlled sweep so the update
does not cause a thundering herd of recomputations. Consistency is relaxed by
design: it is acceptable for a user to see a forecast from a few minutes ago, so
staleness bounds are generous and the system can absorb far more load than one
that requires strong consistency on every read.

### Q4. How do you geocode locations and reverse-geocode?

Geocoding turns free-form input into coordinates, and reverse geocoding turns
coordinates back into a human-readable place name. The forward direction is what
powers the main search box: the service normalizes the query, expands common
abbreviations, and matches against a database of places with their bounding
boxes and coordinate centroids. Matching is scored by population size and type,
so a query for "Springfield" prefers the largest city over smaller towns, and
partial matches are ranked using prefix and n-gram indexes. Ambiguous queries
are resolved by also using the user's current location or time zone when
available.

The internal representation is a geohash or a hierarchical grid index, which
gives the service fast prefix lookups: any prefix of a geohash corresponds to a
rectangular region, so a bounding-box search becomes a string prefix scan.
Geocoding results are cached aggressively, both because location queries repeat
heavily and because the place database changes slowly. The reverse direction
starts from the snapped grid cell and walks up the hierarchy to find the nearest
named locality, district, and country, which the forecast response uses to
display a location label.

Accuracy and privacy pull in opposite directions. High precision is useful for
personalized forecasts, but storing exact coordinates is sensitive, so the
service works with grid-cell granularity and truncates coordinates in logs and
analytics. Rare or newly named places, such as a new subdivision, must be added
without a full reindex, so the place database supports incremental updates that
are promoted into the search index on a schedule. Every geocode result carries a
confidence score, and low-confidence queries fall back to a disambiguation step
or prompt the user rather than guessing.

### Q5. How do you push severe weather alerts?

Severe weather alerts are the feature where being fast matters most, so the path
is separate from normal forecast serving. The Alert Engine continuously watches
incoming forecast and observation data and applies threshold rules, such as wind
speed above a limit or a heat index above a bound, per grid cell. When a
threshold trips, the engine determines the affected geographic region and the
population it covers, then creates an alert event. The event goes into the Alert
Queue rather than being pushed synchronously, because one storm cell can
generate millions of individual notifications and the delivery pipeline must
absorb that burst without losing events.

Delivery is fan-out with deduplication. Each device is registered with its
location, and the engine maps those registrations onto the affected cells to
build the audience for a specific alert. Deduplication prevents a device from
receiving the same alert from multiple grid cells or multiple model runs, so an
alert carries an event identifier and devices suppress repeats. Updates are
handled by alert lifecycle states: a new alert, an upgrade or downgrade, and an
expiration. Expiring an alert is as important as issuing it, because stale
warnings destroy trust in the product.

Reliability engineering dominates the design. A missed severe weather alert is a
genuine safety failure, so the alert pipeline is built with redundant queues,
at-least-once delivery with idempotent handling on the device side, and
independent infrastructure from the forecast read path. Throttling is still
required, since sending every cell's alert to every nearby device would spam
users; the engine coalesces alerts by severity and region, including a severity
downgrade for devices that have already been notified recently. The final design
trades some latency for enormous robustness, which is the right trade for this
feature.

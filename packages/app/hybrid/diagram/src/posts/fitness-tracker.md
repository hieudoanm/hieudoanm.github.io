## Answers

### Q1. Design a fitness / activity tracking service

A fitness tracker is a write-heavy data pipeline in front of a social product:
athletes record workouts, GPS points stream in, and statistics and challenges
are derived from that data. I would structure it as a gateway in front of an
activity ingest service, GPS processing, a workout store, and stats, segments,
social, and leaderboard services, with a Profiles DB for athletes. The write
path is high-frequency during workouts; the read path is mostly short queries
for the latest summary. This split matters because a user's peak ingestion
happens in the evening and on weekends, so ingest capacity must be planned for
those bursts.

An athlete records a workout in the app; points upload to ingest, are smoothed
by GPS processing, and are saved to the workout store. The same processing pass
feeds the stats engine, which summarizes distance, pace, and elevation, and the
segment engine, which matches the track against known segments. The workout can
then be shared to the social feed, where leaderboards rank it against friends
and challenges, and notifications celebrate achievements. Privacy settings gate
every derived view, so the social layer reads through a permission check rather
than trusting the raw data.

I would design the workout record as immutable: once saved, a completed activity
is never rewritten, only annotated. That makes caching, recomputation, and
leaderboard rebuilds idempotent. The tradeoff is between real-time processing
during the activity and eventual batch analysis after it ends; a good middle
ground is to write summary rows continuously during recording and defer heavy
analytics like segment matching to a worker queue. Leaderboards and challenges
refresh asynchronously so an athlete finishing a run does not wait for a global
rank.

### Q2. How do you ingest high-frequency GPS track points?

A one-hour run at one point per second produces thousands of points, and
millions of concurrent workouts mean the ingest path must be cheap and durable.
I would accept uploads in compressed batches through the gateway into an ingest
service that buffers to a queue, then batch-write to the workout store. The
athlete's device is authoritative for timing, so the system stores raw points
first and does processing asynchronously, never making the upload wait for
analytics. Batching by the client also reduces mobile battery drain, which
matters more than a few seconds of upload latency.

Deduplication matters because devices retry failed uploads. Each point batch
carries a monotonic sequence and a workout id, and the store ignores sequences
already received. I would partition the workout store by workout id so all
points of one activity land on one node, making aggregation and range queries
fast, and use a time-series-friendly format with compression for storage cost
since GPS data is voluminous. Dead-letter handling catches malformed batches so
a buggy device firmware does not corrupt an entire workout.

The tradeoff is real-time feedback versus final accuracy. During the workout the
app shows live pace from smoothed points, while the stored, authoritative record
is reprocessed after upload. Smoothing removes GPS jitter but risks
over-filtering; I would run multiple smoothing passes for display and keep the
raw points for recomputation when a device supplies better-grade accuracy later.
Resume semantics allow a partially uploaded workout to be finished on the next
sync, tolerating dropped connections mid-run.

### Q3. How do you compute routes and segment stats?

Computing a route's stats is a geometry problem: snap raw points to a map,
measure distance, elevation, and pace, and produce a polyline that renders
smoothly in the UI. I would run map matching against the road and trail graph to
project each point onto the nearest path, then compute segment-by-segment
distances and cumulative elevation gain from the smoothed track. This is
expensive enough that it belongs in a worker, not the request path. Heart rate
and power data ride along on the same points, so the summary includes cardio
zones and workout load computed in the same pass.

Segments are the killer feature: known named sections of road or trail with
their own leaderboards. The segment engine indexes segments by bounding box,
matches each new workout track against candidate segments by proximity, and
computes the athlete's time on each matched segment. Because the same route can
be run many times, the engine emits a segment effort record that feeds both the
athlete's personal records and the global leaderboard. Climbing segments treat
grade-adjusted time rather than raw time, which requires grade data from the
map, so segment matching bundles the map tile lookup.

The tradeoff is accuracy versus cost. Naive point-to-point distance
overestimates on trails because of GPS error; map matching fixes this but
requires a geospatial index and can be slow for long activities. I would cache
matched segments per workout and store raw point counts, letting the stats
engine re-derive summaries cheaply whenever a better map or algorithm ships,
since workout records are immutable and reprocessing is idempotent. The pipeline
emits segments in order of confidence and discards matches that are
geometrically implausible.

### Q4. How do you build leaderboards and challenges?

Leaderboards are read-heavy rank queries over segment efforts and challenge
participation, so I would keep them derived and cached rather than computed per
request. When a segment effort is recorded, a leaderboard worker updates the
segment's ranked set; on the read side, a user's rank is a lookup into that set.
Global boards are huge, so I would shard the ranked set by segment or challenge
and provide top-N plus rank-around-me views. Friends leaderboards are a join
between the athlete's social graph and the effort set, so the worker keeps a
per-user friend-board cache.

Challenges define a goal (distance in a month, a climbing total) and a window;
each participant's progress aggregates from workout summaries over the window.
Progress is materialized incrementally and cached with a short TTL, and
milestone events fire notifications when an athlete crosses a threshold or
overtakes a friend. Because challenges are temporal, the pipeline rolls them on
a schedule and archives completed ones without blocking new ones. Group
challenges need anti-flocking rules, and activity types like runs versus rides
rank in separate boards.

The hard part is fairness at scale: recomputing all ranks after every effort is
impossible, so leaderboards use approximate or batched updates. I would accept
that the board is eventually consistent, typically refreshing within minutes,
and expose the refresh time to avoid confusion. Anti-cheating matters for
credibility; a validation layer flags implausible efforts, like distances
inconsistent with the track, before they enter the board, trading a little
latency for trust. The same materialized views power the medals and the
year-in-review summary, so one pipeline serves many products.

### Q5. How do you make the social feed real-time?

The social feed is a fan-out problem: when an athlete shares a workout,
followers should see it almost immediately. I would implement a push-based
fan-out on share events, writing the activity summary into each follower's feed
cache, and fall back to a pull-based merge when follower counts exceed a
threshold, because celebrity athletes would otherwise create write amplification
at share time. Interaction events like kudos and comments flow through the same
pipeline, and the composer sends a lightweight update rather than the full
workout record.

Real-time delivery needs a persistent channel. The notification service pushes
updates over WebSockets or server-sent events when the client is online, and
stores a digest for offline clients that rehydrate on reconnect. I would order
feed items by a shared timeline clock, so devices converge on the same ordering,
and deduplicate kudos, comments, and new-workout events that arrive as both push
and poll. Client-side optimistic rendering covers the gap between the athlete's
own completion and the follower's view.

The tradeoff is between freshness and load. Per-follower caches make reads
trivial but amplify writes; read-through merging keeps writes cheap but risks a
thundering herd when a viral workout lands. I would start with the hybrid: push
for small graphs, pull with caching for large ones, and tune the boundary from
metrics. Feed content is derived from immutable workout records, so a feed
rebuild from scratch is always possible and consistent. Capacity planning
follows time zones, since the evening run wave cascades around the globe and the
feed pipeline must absorb it without head-of-line blocking.

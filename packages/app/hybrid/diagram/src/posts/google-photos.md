- How do you generate and serve thumbnails at scale?
- How do you design sharing and permissions?

## Answers

### Q1. Design a photo backup and sharing service

The service has three workloads: a high-throughput upload path, a processing
pipeline that enriches each photo, and a fast browse/serve path. Uploads stream
to an object storage layer with resumable multipart transfer, then enqueue a
processing job; the processing pipeline generates thumbnails and multiple
resolution variants, extracts EXIF metadata, runs face recognition and scene
tagging, and records everything into a metadata store. Browse goes through the
API gateway to a catalog service that reads the metadata store and serves
thumbnails from a thumbnail cache backed by object storage. Sharing is a
separate permission layer: albums group photos, and share links or collaborator
grants control read access for each item.

Storage and metadata are separated deliberately. The original image bytes live
in object storage addressed by content hash, so identical photos dedupe to a
single blob; the metadata store holds per-photo rows (owner, captured-at,
location, tags, face IDs, album membership, visibility) in a sharded database,
with a search index for queries like "photos of person X in 2023." This split
means browse traffic never touches the raw blobs — it reads metadata and streams
low-res variants — while originals are fetched only for download or
full-resolution view. The system must handle billions of photos, so the catalog
is partitioned by owner, writes are batched, and the processing queue is
elastic: encode and tagging workers scale with backlog, and everything is
idempotent so a failed job can be retried safely.

### Q2. How do you handle large uploads and duplicate detection?

Large photos (and videos) are uploaded with resumable chunked transfer: the
client slices the file into fixed-size parts, uploads each with a part ID, and
the upload service reassembles them on the server side or signs a
direct-to-storage path. A failed chunk retries without re-sending the whole
file, and a session token tracks progress so an interrupted phone upload resumes
later. Deduplication is content-based: the client computes a hash (e.g.,
SHA-256) of the full file and the server maintains a hash → blob map in a dedup
index; if the hash already exists under the same owner, the upload records a new
photo row referencing the existing blob and skips the bytes — a huge saving
because the same vacation photo often arrives via camera, WhatsApp, and
screenshots. Across owners, storage can be shared at the blob level with
per-owner metadata rows and reference counting.

Racing uploads and hash collisions are the edge cases. Two concurrent uploads of
the same file must resolve to one blob, so the dedup check happens inside an
atomic insert with a unique hash key — the loser becomes a second reference
rather than a second copy. For videos and RAW files the same flow applies, with
the upload service holding a manifest of parts until the final "complete" call.
Because hashes are computed client-side, the server never trusts them blindly: a
verification step can sample bytes on first write, and corrupt files are
rejected at the validate stage before they are promoted to the visible library.
The upload path is also throttled and queued so a full-library backup doesn't
starve other traffic.

### Q3. How do you organize photos by time, location, and people?

Organization is metadata-driven. Capture time comes from EXIF (falling back to
file timestamp); location comes from GPS coordinates in EXIF that are
reverse-geocoded into city/country labels; people come from a face recognition
model. The processing pipeline runs face detection to crop a normalized face
region, embeds it into a feature vector, and clusters vectors by identity using
an offline clustering job (e.g., hierarchical or agglomerative clustering on
embeddings, re-run periodically as new photos arrive). Each cluster becomes a
person entity in a face index, and the user confirms or merges clusters through
the UI, which feeds the labels back as training signal. Scene tags (sunset,
beach, dog) come from a parallel classifier on the thumbnail.

Queries combine these facets. The catalog service exposes the photo rows to a
search index so "dogs in 2021 near the beach" is a structured query over tags,
time range, and geohash. The trade-off is between online classification (low
latency, per-upload cost) and offline clustering (batch, global consistency).
Face clustering is necessarily offline and can be slow, so the UI shows a
"recently added" set immediately and the full People view fills in as clusters
land. Duplicates and near-duplicates (same scene, slightly different angle) are
handled by a separate similarity pass that groups them, letting the user clean
up. All of this metadata is derived data — it can be regenerated by
reprocessing, so the original photos remain the source of truth and new models
re-run over the library without rewriting blobs.

### Q4. How do you generate and serve thumbnails at scale?

Thumbnail generation is a classic write-once, read-many pattern handled by a
processing pipeline. After upload, a job enqueues the photo; a thumbnail worker
decodes the image and renders multiple variants (e.g., 256px, 512px, 1080px,
full-view) into object storage, then writes a manifest row into the metadata
store. Because decode is CPU-heavy, workers scale horizontally with the queue
and the work is partitioned so big bursts (a phone dumping 5,000 photos) drain
predictably; a pyramid of progressively larger variants lets the client request
exactly the size it needs. Serving is CDN-first: thumbnails live in object
storage behind a CDN with long TTLs and cache keys that include the variant
size, so repeated scrolls and shared links hit edge caches and never touch
compute.

The hard problem is latency on cold paths. The client wants to scroll instantly
while thumbnails are still being generated, so the UI streams low-res
placeholders (a tiny embedded preview or the first generated variant) and
upgrades as variants land; the metadata store records generation state per
photo. A thumbnail cache (an in-memory/edge cache in front of storage) absorbs
the hottest items, and cache-miss storms on a newly uploaded batch are smoothed
by generating on-demand as a fallback for rarely viewed originals. Trade-offs:
generating every variant for every photo wastes compute, so a size-on-demand
policy is used for full-view originals, while only the grid-size thumbnails are
pre-generated. Monitoring tracks encode throughput, queue backlog, and thumbnail
cache hit rate to keep scroll latency under budget.

### Q5. How do you design sharing and permissions?

Sharing is an access-control layer over otherwise private photos. Each photo and
album carries an ACL: owner, plus granted collaborators and share links. A share
service issues two kinds of grants — user-scoped (a friend's account ID with
viewer/contributor roles) and link-scoped (an opaque token URL that grants
anyone with the link read or contribute access) — and the catalog service
filters every read against the ACL. Sharing is post-composed: a shared album is
not a copy of photos but a view that references items by ID, so when the owner
edits or deletes a photo, the effect is visible to everyone with access, which
is the expected behavior in a photo service.

Security and scale trade-offs follow. Permissions are cached with the session
and enforced at the API layer; the metadata store and search index are filtered
with the same ACL so sharing can't leak via search. Token links are the tricky
surface: they are shareable by forwarding, so the system supports link
expiration, revoke-by-reissue (rotating the token invalidates old links), and
abuse detection on unusual download spikes. When an owner is removed from an
album or deletes their account, a revocation sweep updates the grants. Because
ACL checks happen per photo read, hot shared albums are cached along with their
grant lists, and the share service keeps an audit log of who granted access to
whom — the compliance record for "did anyone see this photo" queries. The
invariant is that object storage blobs are never directly reachable; every read
passes through the permission layer.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a vector database

A vector database stores embeddings — dense numeric vectors produced by machine
learning models — and answers similarity queries: given a vector, return the
most similar vectors. The core components are an embedding service that converts
text, images, or other inputs into vectors using an embedding model; a vector
index that organizes vectors for fast approximate lookup; an ANN search engine
that probes the index; a metadata store that holds the structured fields
attached to each vector; and an ingestion queue that decouples writes from index
updates. The gateway accepts both queries and upserts, and a re-ranking step
refines approximate results before returning the top k.

Two things distinguish a vector database from a plain ANN library: it manages
the full lifecycle of vectors, and it combines vector similarity with metadata
filtering. Each vector carries an ID and metadata — tenant, type, timestamp,
labels — and search can constrain candidates by those fields before or after the
vector search. The service must also keep the index consistent with the metadata
store, handle deletes and updates without corruption, and serve many tenants
without one tenant's load or data leaking into another's results. Latency
targets are strict because vector search sits on the query path of features like
semantic search, recommendations, and retrieval-augmented generation, so the
read path must stay sub-second at scale. Operational concerns round out the
design: observability into index build progress, recall probes that sample query
results against an exact search, and capacity planning for the memory that
in-memory indexes require.

### Q2. How do you index millions of vectors?

Exact nearest-neighbor search is linear per query and does not scale past a few
million vectors, so the index is approximate by design. The dominant structure
is HNSW — a hierarchical graph of small-world links where queries start at a
coarse layer and descend to a fine layer, following edges to neighbors. HNSW
gives excellent recall and low latency but keeps all vectors in memory, which is
expensive at very large scale. The alternative is IVF — an inverted-file index
that clusters vectors at build time and searches only the clusters nearest the
query — which trades a little recall for much lower memory and works well with
disk-backed storage. Many systems layer the two: IVF for the on-disk population
and HNSW for hot partitions.

Index quality degrades as vectors are inserted, so the database uses a two-tier
model: new vectors land in a small, freshly built index while the large index
serves reads, and a background process merges the small index into the large
one, or rebuilds it incrementally, during quiet periods. This separates the
write path from the read path. Memory is the scarce resource, so the database
quantizes vectors — scalar or product quantization — shrinking each vector to a
fraction of its size with bounded recall loss, and it may keep full-precision
vectors only for re-ranking. The choice of index and its parameters is exposed
per collection, because recall, memory, and latency trade off differently for
different workloads. Per-workload profiles make the choice explicit and
repeatable.

### Q3. How do you run approximate nearest neighbor search?

Approximate nearest neighbor search trades a guaranteed exact answer for a much
faster one. The ANN engine receives a query vector, walks the index — following
graph edges in HNSW or probing the nearest clusters in IVF — and returns a
candidate set that is a superset of the best matches. Each candidate is scored
by exact distance to the query, and the top k by score are returned. The
tradeoff is controlled by parameters: the number of probes or the graph's search
effort, which the caller or the service sets per query. Higher effort means
better recall at higher latency, and production systems expose recall as a
query-level dial rather than a hidden constant.

The candidate set then flows through the rest of the pipeline. Metadata filters
prune candidates whose attributes do not match, and a re-ranking stage applies a
more expensive but more accurate scoring — full-precision distance,
cross-encoder relevance, or business rank — over the remaining candidates before
the final top k is returned. This coarse-to-fine structure is what makes the
system practical: the cheap ANN pass narrows millions of vectors to hundreds,
and the expensive pass scores only those hundreds. ANN search is also highly
parallel, so the engine probes many graph layers or clusters concurrently and
uses SIMD-optimized distance kernels to keep the per-query cost small. The
engine also bounds worst-case latency: a probe budget caps how many clusters or
graph edges a query may visit, so even a pathological query returns within the
service-level objective.

### Q4. How do you handle hybrid search with filters?

Pure vector similarity is rarely the whole query. Real workloads filter by
tenant, type, date, price, or category, and hybrid search must combine vector
ranking with metadata predicates. The clean approaches sit at two extremes:
filter-then-search scans the index but restricts candidates to those matching
the filter, which is precise but slow when the filter is selective;
search-then-filter runs the ANN search and drops non-matching results, which is
fast but can return too few matches when the filter eliminates most of the
candidate set. The database supports both and picks based on the filter's
selectivity, since neither works well for all cases.

The middle ground is pre-filtering integrated into the index. In IVF, each
cluster carries a metadata bitmap, and the query skips clusters or probes within
clusters using the filter, so selectivity is applied during the walk rather than
after it. In HNSW, filtering happens during graph traversal — edges to nodes
that fail the filter are not followed, with careful handling to avoid getting
stuck in dead ends. The metadata store keeps inverted or bitwise indexes over
attributes so selectivity estimates are cheap, and the query planner uses those
estimates to choose filter-then-search, search-then-filter, or filtered
traversal. The re-ranking stage is the final arbiter, and it can also enforce
hard predicates that the approximate pass could not guarantee, keeping hybrid
results both relevant and correct. Because metadata filters are also used for
security isolation, the planner treats tenant predicates as mandatory, applying
them before ranking and never leaking candidates across the boundary.

### Q5. How do you keep embeddings fresh?

Embeddings go stale in two ways: the underlying item changes, and the model that
produced the vectors changes. The service handles the first through the
ingestion queue — each upsert carries the new vector and version, the queue
orders updates, and the index is updated in the background so reads never block
writes. Deletes and updates are tombstoned in the metadata store and lazily
removed from the index during compaction, because surgically removing a point
from an HNSW graph or an IVF cluster is expensive and error-prone. Consumers are
told to re-embed on source data change, and the database tracks vector
provenance — which model, which version, which timestamp — so stale rows are
detectable.

Model changes are the harder problem because a new embedding model changes the
meaning of every vector, and mixing vectors from different models in one index
silently corrupts similarity. The service therefore supports model-versioned
collections: a new model version gets its own index or namespace, queries are
routed against a consistent model version, and migration is a background rebuild
that re-encodes the source data and swaps the index atomically. This is why the
embedding service and the model are explicit components rather than hidden
details. Freshness is also a data-hygiene concern: re-embedding everything
continuously is expensive, so the service prioritizes re-encoding by churn and
staleness age, and it exposes an API for callers to trigger selective
re-embedding after important updates. Observability for freshness tracks
re-embed lag per collection, so operators can see when a model or data change is
still producing stale vectors in search results.

# DoorDash — Food Delivery

Customer and dasher apps, restaurant search, order dispatch, live tracking.

## Interview Questions

- Design DoorDash / a food delivery service
- How do you match orders to nearby dashers?
- How do you show live order tracking with low latency?
- Design the order lifecycle from pickup to delivery
- How do you handle surge demand during lunch and dinner?

## Answers

### Q1. Design DoorDash / a food delivery service

There are two client surfaces (customer and dasher) fronted by an API gateway.
Restaurant search is backed by a geospatial index and a menu cache; the order
service creates orders, integrates payment, and persists to the orders DB.
Dispatch matches orders to nearby dashers using the geo index, sends offers with
a TTL, and tracks acceptances. The tracking service ingests dasher locations
over WebSockets and streams live status to the customer. Notifications handle
push and SMS. The hardest component is dispatch: zone-based matching, offer
negotiation, and batching. Use geo hashing (S2/GeoHash) for proximity, Kafka for
event-driven state transitions, idempotent payments, and an explicit state
machine for the order lifecycle.

### Q2. How do you match orders to nearby dashers?

Dasher apps stream location updates into a geospatial index (S2 cells or
GeoHash) in Redis. On order placement, the dispatch service queries dashers
within a radius and scores candidates by proximity, ETA, current load (active
orders), availability, and ratings. Matching is auction-style: send offers with
a short TTL, and assign on acceptance, or re-dispatch after timeout or decline.
Zone-based partitioning keeps matching local so dispatch workers don't need
global coordination. During peaks, batch stacked orders along an optimized route
so one dasher serves multiple orders. The goal is to minimize order-to-accept
latency while keeping dashers efficient and balanced across zones.

### Q3. How do you show live order tracking with low latency?

Dasher apps report GPS every few seconds over WebSockets; the tracking service
ingests these events, publishes to Kafka, and forwards updates through a
realtime hub to the customer's subscribed socket. Keep a publish-subscribe model
keyed by order id so each customer receives only their order's updates, and
offer short-interval polling as a fallback for clients that drop the socket.
Compute ETA server-side from route and predicted speed, pushing snapshots rather
than raw coordinates. Consider: filter noisy GPS readings, resume reconnects
with the last-known position, and place realtime hubs regionally so updates
travel minimal network distance to the customer.

### Q4. Design the order lifecycle from pickup to delivery

Model the order as an explicit state machine: created to payment authorized,
placed, preparing, ready, dasher assigned, picked up, in transit, delivered,
with failure states such as canceled, failed payment, or no dasher found. The
order service persists state to the orders DB and emits an event per transition
to Kafka; downstream services (dispatch, tracking, notifications, payment) react
to those events. Idempotency keys protect payment retries, and timeouts drive
escalation when a dasher doesn't accept or pickup stalls. Use the outbox pattern
so event emission is atomic with the DB write, and sagas coordinate
cross-service steps without distributed transactions.

### Q5. How do you handle surge demand during lunch and dinner?

Expect a 5–10x peak and plan capacity accordingly: queue orders when dasher
supply is short, autoscale stateless services on CPU and queue depth, and scale
stateful stores with orders DB read replicas and Redis. Buffer spikes in Kafka
so downstream consumers drain at their own pace. On the supply side, use
demand-based surge pricing and boost-zone incentives to pull more dashers
online, and batch stacked orders. Cache menu and search read paths to absorb
browse traffic. Protect the API gateway with rate limiting and backpressure,
keep payment idempotency intact under retry storms, and degrade gracefully with
extended-ETA messaging rather than hard failure.

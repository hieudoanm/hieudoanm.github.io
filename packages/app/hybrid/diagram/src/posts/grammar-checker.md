## Answers

### Q1. Design a grammar and writing assistant

A writing assistant inspects text as it is typed and flags grammar, style, and
clarity issues with suggestions. The request path starts in the Editor Plugin,
which batches a segment of the user's writing and submits it through the API
Gateway. The Parsing Service splits the text into sentences and builds a
syntactic parse, then hands the parsed structure to the Rule Engine, which
applies deterministic grammar and punctuation rules. The Language Model verifies
and augments the rule findings with a softer, statistical view of what a fluent
speaker would write. The Style Scorer evaluates the same text for readability
and tone, and the Rewrite Service turns any flagged issue into concrete
suggested text that flows back to the plugin for display.

The key architectural decision is layering deterministic rules under a language
model. Rules are fast, explainable, and precise for the cases they cover, such
as subject-verb agreement and comma placement. The model catches everything a
rule list cannot enumerate, but it is slower, more expensive, and harder to
explain. By running rules first and using the model for verification and
coverage of the long tail, the system keeps the common path cheap while still
handling novel phrasing. A Check Cache memoizes identical segments, and a
Privacy Filter sits between the user and storage so raw text never reaches
persistent logs unfiltered.

Latency is the binding constraint because checking is interactive. The plugin
submits a sentence at a time, not a whole document, so the first result arrives
in a few hundred milliseconds and the rest stream in. The pipeline is designed
to return partial results, showing the certain rule findings immediately and
appending model-driven suggestions as they finish. Scale is handled by stateless
services behind the gateway, so check capacity grows by adding instances, and
the cache absorbs the heavy duplication of people writing similar sentences.

### Q2. How do you detect grammar errors at scale?

Grammar detection starts with parsing. The Parsing Service must assign a
parts-of-speech tag and a dependency or phrase-structure parse to every
sentence, because nearly every grammar rule is expressed over that structure.
The parser runs on a server with precomputed models, and the resulting tree is
the shared input to all downstream stages. Parsing is the expensive part of the
pipeline, so it is the natural place to cache and to bound input size. Sentences
are processed independently, which makes the work embarrassingly parallel across
the fleet and across the document.

On top of the parse, the Rule Engine applies a catalog of deterministic checks.
Each rule is a pattern over tokens and their syntactic roles, such as "a
determiner before a plural noun is missing" or "the verb does not agree with the
subject in person and number". Rules are compiled into an efficient matcher that
walks the parse once, and each match produces a category, a severity, and a
message. This stage is extremely fast and fully deterministic, which means it is
unit-testable and its behavior can be tuned precisely. The rule catalog is
versioned and shipped as data, not code, so new checks deploy without
redeploying services.

Scaling detection means making the pipeline stateless and horizontally
replicable. Any instance can parse and check any sentence, so the gateway
load-balances freely and failures are retried on a different instance. The
per-instance cache stores parses and results keyed by a hash of the text, so
repeated submissions of the same sentence, which happen constantly in editing,
never reach the parser again. Throughput is governed by parser cost rather than
rule cost, so the system measures parser latency and autoscales that tier
aggressively while the rule tier rides along cheaply.

### Q3. How do you combine rules with language models?

Rules and language models are complementary, and the architecture treats the
model as a verification and generalization layer rather than a replacement. A
rule fires with high precision on a narrow pattern, but it cannot judge whether
the flagged construction is actually natural in context. The Language Model
scores the sentence as written and the sentence as the rule proposes fixing it;
if the model strongly prefers the corrected version, the suggestion is surfaced
with confidence, and if the model considers both equally natural or prefers the
original, the finding is downgraded or suppressed. This prevents the classic
failure where a grammar checker corrects idiomatic phrasing into stilted prose.

The model also extends coverage to errors no rule encodes. Agreement between
distant words, awkward collocations, and preposition choices are all better
expressed as probabilities over a sequence than as pattern matches. For these,
the model produces a candidate repair by scoring alternative continuations and
selecting the most probable one, subject to a minimum confidence threshold.
Because model inference is expensive, the pipeline runs rules first and only
invokes the model when needed, either to verify a rule finding or to examine
sentence regions that rules could not classify confidently.

Combining the two requires a confidence framework that decides which source wins
when they disagree. Every finding carries a score, and a policy layer merges
rule findings and model findings into a single ordered list for the user. The
merge is tuned against labeled evaluation data, where the ground truth is
whether a native speaker would accept the suggestion. The language model itself
is versioned and monitored for drift, and both the rule output and the model
output are logged so the team can trace why a particular suggestion appeared.

### Q4. How do you suggest style improvements?

Style is distinct from grammar: grammar errors are objectively wrong, while
style suggestions are about clarity, tone, and readability. The Style Scorer
evaluates the text along dimensions such as sentence length, passive voice,
nominalizations, redundancy, and vocabulary sophistication. Each dimension
produces a score, and the scores are combined into an overall readability and
tone profile. The scorer is deliberately rule-based and interpretable, so a user
can see why a suggestion was made, rather than a black box. Style preferences
differ by audience, so the scorer is parameterized by a target tone, such as
formal, casual, or persuasive.

The Rewrite Service turns a style score into concrete text. For each dimension
that falls below target, it generates one or more rewrites of the affected
sentence, favoring minimal edits over wholesale rewrites because users accept
small changes far more often. The Language Model generates the candidate
rewrites, and a scoring step selects the best one by balancing fluency, the
style score improvement, and the edit distance from the original. Suggestions
that change the user's meaning are rejected, which is the critical quality gate,
because a fluent but wrong rewrite destroys trust.

Style suggestions are served separately from grammar findings so the user can
act on them selectively. Because style is subjective, the system learns
preferences from the user's accept and dismiss behavior, stored per user and
used to tune the style targets and the rewrite style. Aggregated acceptance data
also tunes the global system, so the rewrite selector improves over time. The
whole stage is designed to be conservative: a missed style suggestion costs
little, while a bad rewrite that misrepresents the user's words costs a lot.

### Q5. How do you protect user privacy?

The writing that flows through the system is deeply sensitive, so privacy is an
architectural requirement rather than an afterthought. The Privacy Filter is
placed on the write path, before any text is stored or sent to external
services. Its job is to transform the user's text into a form that cannot be
reassembled into the original while still being usable for improvement. The
filter strips identifiers, hashes substrings, and can redact or replace named
entities, and only the scrubbed form reaches the cache, the Usage DB, and any
logging. The raw text exists only transiently in the request pipeline and is
never persisted.

The serving path is designed to minimize contact with raw text at all. Inference
runs on infrastructure that is contractually isolated, and the privacy scrub
applies to cache keys and stored check results so that even a compromised cache
cannot reveal what the user wrote. When external language model providers are
used, only the minimal sentence needed for inference is sent, with the same
scrubbing applied, and a policy requires that inputs are not retained. The user
controls the tradeoff explicitly, with toggles for whether their text may be
used to improve the product at all.

Privacy protection extends to what can be inferred from behavior. The system
avoids storing user-identifiable writing patterns in the Usage DB, keeping only
aggregated, anonymized error and acceptance statistics that cannot be joined
back to an individual. Differential aggregation and strict access controls cover
the analytics tier. The design treats privacy as a data-flow property: any
component that touches text must declare whether it stores, retains, or shares,
and the Privacy Filter enforces those declarations at the boundary. The result
is that the product can learn from mistakes without ever learning what the user
actually wrote.

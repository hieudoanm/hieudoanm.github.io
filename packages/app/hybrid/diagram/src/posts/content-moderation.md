## Answers

### Q1. Design a content moderation system

A content moderation system screens every upload against a content policy and
decides what is allowed, what is removed, and what needs a human judgment. The
upload flows from the client through the API Gateway into the Moderation
Pipeline, which runs automated checks in parallel. The Image Detector and the
Text Detector each invoke the ML Models tier, a set of specialized models for
categories such as adult content, violence, hate speech, and spam, and each
model returns a category and a confidence score. The pipeline combines the
scores into a single policy verdict. Clear violations are rejected immediately,
clearly clean content is accepted, and everything in the middle is routed to the
Human Review queue, where reviewers adjudicate and the decision is recorded in
the Moderation DB before the user is notified.

The architecture is organized around the cost of mistakes. A false positive,
removing content that is fine, is a user trust failure, while a false negative,
letting a violation through, is a safety failure, and the tiered design lets the
operator choose the balance for each content type and audience. Latency and
throughput also pull in opposite directions: the automated path must be fast
enough to feel synchronous, typically under a second for the verdict, while the
human path is inherently slower and asynchronous. The design therefore keeps the
automated verdict path as the scaling core and treats human review as a managed
backlog with priority classes rather than as part of the request hot path.

Moderation is also a continuously changing problem. Policy changes, new attack
patterns, and model updates mean the system is never finished. Every automated
decision is logged with the full feature vector that produced it, so a policy
change can be replayed over historical decisions without reprocessing the
original media. The pipeline is versioned as a whole, and shadow runs of a new
model version are compared against the current one before rollout. This makes
the moderation system as much a data platform as a classifier.

### Q2. How do you detect violating images and text?

Image and text detection both follow the pattern of running multiple specialized
models and combining their scores, but the media processing is very different.
For images, the pipeline first produces compact representations: it downscales
the image, samples frames for video, extracts perceptual hashes, and generates
embeddings from a vision model. The perceptual hash enables instant matching
against a database of known bad content, and the embedding enables similarity
search against known violating categories. Deep learning classifiers then score
the image for each policy category, and the scores are combined with a
category-specific aggregation, so nudity and violence are evaluated with
separate models and separate thresholds.

Text detection works on the text content plus the context around it. The Text
Detector scans the visible text, including OCR for text inside images, and also
the metadata, captions, and comments, because a violation can hide in any of
them. Rule-based signals catch obvious spam, exact-match blocklists for known
terms and URLs, while a language model scores the semantic content for
categories such as hate speech and harassment. Because text is cheap to
reprocess, the text path runs more models and is more tolerant of adding checks
than the image path. Both paths emit category, confidence, and a set of
explaining features that a human reviewer can inspect.

Detection must anticipate evasion. Users and attackers adapt, so the system
combines deterministic checks with learned ones: hashes catch exact reuse,
similarity search catches near duplicates such as recolored or mirrored images,
and the learned classifiers catch novel content. Adversarial modifications are
measured by how often modified content evades the classifiers, and evasion
samples are fed back as training data. The scoring is calibrated so that
borderline categories are routed to human review instead of being decided by a
low-confidence model, which is the design's acknowledgment that automated
detection will never be perfect and the system must know when it is not certain.

### Q3. How do you combine automated and human review?

The combination is a triage system with a feedback loop. The Moderation Pipeline
classifies every item into one of three buckets: clearly allowed, clearly
violating, or uncertain. Only the uncertain bucket goes to the Human Review
queue, which keeps human effort proportional to the genuinely hard cases. Items
in the queue are prioritized by risk, such as content from new accounts, content
with high reach, and categories with the most severe consequences, so that the
highest-impact decisions are made first. Reviewers work in a workspace that
shows the item, the model scores, and the explaining features, so a human
decision is informed rather than blind.

Human decisions are not just final answers; they are training data. Every
reviewed item is recorded in the Moderation DB with the model scores that were
present when the review was made, and this labeled set is sampled to retrain the
classifiers and recalibrate thresholds. Review consistency is measured by
sending calibration items, items with a known correct answer, to reviewers, and
inconsistent reviewers are retrained or reassigned. Disagreement between
reviewers on the same item is itself a signal: when humans cannot agree, the
policy needs clarification, and those items are surfaced to the policy team.

The system must also decide what to do with content while it is in review.
Depending on policy and reach, ambiguous content may be held invisible, shown
only to the author, or shown publicly while flagged. This choice is a policy
decision encoded in the pipeline configuration, and it balances free expression
against safety. The feedback loop closes when enough human decisions accumulate
on a category that the automated scores for that category can be trusted to move
more traffic out of the human queue. The goal is a shrinking loop: the
classifiers handle more cases correctly over time, and human reviewers focus on
the long tail of novel and borderline cases.

### Q4. How do you handle policy changes?

Policy changes are handled as data, not code, which is the core design
principle. Each policy is a versioned configuration: a set of categories,
thresholds, and action rules, plus pointers to the model versions that produce
the scores. When policy changes, the operator publishes a new policy version and
chooses a rollout strategy. Because every historical decision is stored with its
feature vector and scores, the impact of a new policy can be estimated by
replaying it over past decisions before going live, showing how many additional
items would be removed or allowed. This replay turns a risky judgment call into
a measurable change.

The rollout itself is staged. The new policy is applied in shadow mode, logging
what it would have decided, while the live policy continues to serve. Once the
shadow results match expectations, the policy is promoted for new content, and
finally a backfill job reprocesses historical content that might be affected,
such as reinstating content that was removed under a now-abolished category.
Backfill is throttled and prioritized, because reprocessing millions of items
against image and text models is expensive. The Moderation DB keeps a full audit
trail: every item records which policy version and model versions produced each
decision, so any decision can be explained.

Changes are also pushed through the model side. A new policy category requires a
new classifier, and an existing category may need retraining on new violations,
so the model pipeline and the policy version are deployed together and versioned
together. Reviewer guidance is updated to match the policy so that human and
automated decisions stay aligned. Measuring the effect of a change continues
after rollout: policy teams watch the rate of human reversals, appeals, and user
reports around the changed categories, because the ultimate check on a policy
change is whether decisions made under it hold up in practice.

### Q5. How do you scale to millions of uploads?

Scaling moderation is about making the automated path horizontally scalable and
keeping the human path from becoming the bottleneck. The pipeline is stateless:
every upload is processed by a pool of workers that pull from a submission
queue, so capacity scales by adding workers and the queue absorbs spikes. The
image and text detectors call the ML Models tier through a model serving layer
that batches inference requests for GPU efficiency, exactly like the serving
tier for any other ML product. The first-level checks, hashing, OCR, and
blocklist matching, are designed to be so cheap that they can reject a large
fraction of spam and known violations before any expensive deep-learning model
runs.

The architecture exploits the skew of real traffic. Most uploads are either
obviously clean or obviously malicious, and both are cheap to classify. The
expensive models are reserved for the narrow band of content that needs them, so
the cost per upload is dominated by a few cheap checks rather than a full model
ensemble on everything. Per-account features, such as an account's history of
violations, are used as a prior that changes which checks run and how deep the
pipeline goes. Deduplication across uploads is handled at the hash layer, so the
same spam image uploaded a million times is scanned once and rejected by cache
thereafter.

The human review queue is scaled through queuing discipline rather than just
headcount. Items are prioritized by risk and SLA class, reviewers are assigned
by expertise, for example, the team handling violence differs from the team
handling spam, and the queue is measured by time-to-decision per priority.
Automated checks are always re-run when the human decides, so the model learns
from the review at scale. The whole system is monitored with three metrics:
detection rate, the fraction of violations caught by the automated path, human
queue depth and wait time, and the model cost per upload, and scaling decisions
are made by watching all three together.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a live streaming platform

A live platform has a real-time video pipeline and a real-time interaction
layer. The broadcaster's encoder pushes a single high-bitrate stream (RTMP or
WebRTC/SRT) to the nearest ingestion endpoint, which validates the stream key
and splits the stream into short segments (2–4 seconds). The transcode pipeline
re-encodes into multiple adaptive-bitrate renditions (1080p down to 480p) and
writes them to an origin store; the CDN replicates segments to edge locations
and viewers play via HLS or LL-HLS/CMAF. Parallel to video, a chat service fans
messages out over WebSocket to every viewer of the channel, and a presence
service tracks who is watching. Channel metadata, stream keys, and subscription
state live in a channel DB; a recommender surfaces live channels to viewers.

The design separates stateful real-time components from stateless batch-friendly
ones. Ingest, chat, and presence are stateful and sharded per channel so a
single channel's load stays on a small, warm set of servers; transcoding is a
CPU-heavy, horizontally scalable worker pool sized by concurrent streams and
renditions per stream. Durability matters for live video — segments are written
to origin storage as they are produced so a failed edge can re-serve them — but
old segments are cheap to drop since live video is ephemeral. The platform must
handle huge, spiky fan-out: one stream can be watched by a million people, so
delivery is CDN-only and chat fan-out uses per-channel distribution trees rather
than per-viewer connections to a single server.

### Q2. How do you ingest and transcode live streams?

Ingestion starts when the encoder connects: the broadcaster authenticates with a
stream key, the ingestion endpoint looks up the channel, and the encoder pushes
a continuous stream. The ingest server chunks it into time-aligned segments
(each with an independent keyframe so segments are individually decodable),
writes the original to origin storage for archival, and feeds the transcode
pipeline. Transcoding runs on a pool of GPU/CPU workers: each input rendition is
decoded once, then re-encoded into multiple output renditions — different
resolutions and bitrates — so viewers on slow connections can drop to a lower
rendition without buffering. Each output rendition is segmented and published to
the origin store, and a manifest is updated so players discover the available
renditions. The pipeline is a streaming DAG, not a batch job; workers are
assigned per (channel, rendition) and must keep up in real time — falling behind
means dropped frames and a lagging stream.

Transcode is also where value-add features attach: frame-rate normalization, ad
insertion at segment boundaries, and closed captions. The cost model matters —
transcoding per stream per rendition is expensive, so many platforms transcode
popular channels into many renditions (or use per-viewer transcoding, like
Twitch) while small channels pass through the original single rendition. Segment
loss is handled by origin buffering and retry: a player that misses a segment
requests it again from the CDN/origin before moving on. Monitoring tracks
transcode CPU, pipeline lag, and the percent of segments published within their
target window, because a transcode backlog is the leading indicator of a
degraded broadcast.

### Q3. How do you keep stream latency low across regions?

Latency is bounded by the segment pipeline: broadcast delay equals segment
duration + CDN propagation + player buffer. The pipeline targets low end-to-end
latency (seconds, not tens of seconds) through three levers. First, short
segments: 2-second segments with a player that starts playback as soon as the
first segment and its manifest arrive, rather than buffering several ahead.
Second, low-latency protocols: LL-HLS/CMAF with partial segments, or WebRTC for
the lowest-latency tier, lets players fetch parts of a segment as they are
produced. Third, edge delivery: the CDN pushes newly published segments to edges
in the viewers' regions, and players connect to the nearest edge, so a segment
travels one hop from origin to edge rather than a global round trip. Origin
replication is pre-fetched on demand — the CDN pulls a segment when the first
viewer requests it and caches it for subsequent viewers on that edge.

Latency and quality trade off. Short segments reduce delay but increase encoding
overhead and the chance of playback gaps on lossy networks, so the player
adaptively buffers more when the network is bad and less when it is stable. Live
also has a "time-to-sync" problem: a large global audience experiences different
broadcast latencies, so interaction (chat reacting to a moment) has an inherent
skew; platforms accept skew within a region and prioritize a consistent, low
absolute delay. Monitoring uses player-reported metrics (rebuffer ratio,
time-to-first-frame, end-to-end delay) to tune segment size and buffer policies
per region. For interactive tiers (WebRTC), the control plane picks the nearest
media relay and applies jitter buffering at the player — a pure delay/quality
trade with no CDN in the loop.

### Q4. How do you scale chat alongside the video stream?

Chat is fan-out with strong ordering requirements per channel. When a viewer
sends a message, the gateway validates it (rate limits, moderation) and
publishes it to a per-channel chat topic; a fan-out layer delivers it to every
viewer's WebSocket connection, with per-channel ordering and delivery
confirmation so the message appears in the right sequence for everyone. Channels
are the shard unit: a busy channel gets dedicated chat shards and fan-out
servers, while the per-channel event log (a Kafka-style topic) provides replay
so a reconnecting viewer can backfill the last N messages. Moderation runs at
ingest — filter spam, badges, and slow-mode per channel — and can be stateful
per user so a banned viewer is dropped from delivery. Presence (who is online)
is tracked by the same fan-out layer, which maintains a per-channel member set.

The hard part is a mega-channel: hundreds of thousands of concurrent chatters
make per-message broadcast to every connection a massive fan-out, so the design
uses a multicast tree — a small set of delivery servers, each holding a subset
of connections, receiving each message once and re-broadcasting to their local
sockets — rather than one server sending a million messages. Ordering is relaxed
across shards where acceptable (only the global slow-mode stream must be
strictly ordered) and strict within a viewer's session. Durability is
intentionally shallow: chat is ephemeral, so messages live in a hot cache with a
short retention, while a message index keeps a searchable recent history.
Backpressure is per-connection (slow viewers are dropped or coalesced) and the
channel's message rate is throttled at ingest so fan-out servers can't be
overwhelmed.

### Q5. How do you handle broadcaster failures gracefully?

Broadcasts fail at every layer, and the platform must degrade without harming
viewers or revenue. If the broadcaster's connection drops (network blip, app
crash, power loss), the ingest endpoint detects the idle timeout, flags the
channel as "offline," and emits a status change to presence and the recommender;
viewers see the stream freeze briefly, then an offline card. Reconnect is the
critical path — the encoder reconnects with the same stream key, and the
platform must handle a new session without mixing old and new content: the new
ingest session gets a fresh stream session ID, old segments are invalidated, and
the channel resumes broadcasting with the manifest regenerated. To make
reconnects seamless, the ingest endpoint supports a short grace window where it
buffers a few seconds, and the encoder can fast-reconnect with a session token
that resumes the previous stream.

Mid-stream failures are contained per component. If a transcode worker dies, the
pipeline restarts the rendition from the origin's latest segment and the player
seamlessly falls back to another rendition while it rebuilds. If an edge fails,
the CDN reroutes viewers to a neighboring edge that re-pulls segments from
origin. The channel DB records the outage with timestamps for analytics, and the
platform can auto-restart archived replays so the VOD is not lost even when the
live portion glitched. Operational detection uses watchdog health checks on the
encoder's heartbeat and per-segment publication timestamps; when segments stop
arriving, an alert fires before viewers complain. The design principle is that
the live experience must never take down the broader platform — ingest,
transcode, chat, and presence all degrade independently and recover without a
global restart.

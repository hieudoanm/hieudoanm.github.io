## Answers

### Q1. Design a notes / note-taking app

A notes app is a personal information system: capture on any device, sync to
every device, and retrieve by search. The core artifact is the note, a document
with a title, body, tags, and an optional set of attachments. The architecture
keeps a thin client and a strong server. The Notes App on each device edits
locally, the API gateway accepts uploads and downloads, the Note Service owns
the note records, the Sync Engine reconciles changes between devices, and a
Search Index makes the corpus queryable. Because users trust a notes app with
private data, encryption and access control are first-class, not add-ons.

The write path is designed around sync, not simple saves. When a user creates or
edits a note, the app updates a local copy immediately, then uploads a delta to
the server. The Note Service stores the canonical version in the Notes DB, a
relational store keyed by user, while the Sync Engine records the change as a
versioned operation. Search indexing and sharing events subscribe to the change
stream so they never block the save. This async decoupling is what allows a
device to sync hundreds of changes from offline work in a single batch.

The read path must feel instant. Opening a note on a device that already has it
cached requires no network call; the app reconciles local state with the server
in the background. Attachments go to an object store, fetched lazily through a
CDN so images render fast. Sharing is a layer on top of the note model: a shared
note is a permission entry that lets another user read or edit, with the Sync
Engine pushing updates to collaborators in near real time. The result is a
system optimized for the app's primary promise: your notes are always there,
wherever you are.

### Q2. How do you sync notes across devices?

Cross-device sync is a distributed systems problem dressed up as a feature. Each
device keeps a local copy of a user's notes, and any device can change anything,
so the system must converge without a central lock. The design is
operation-based: every edit becomes an operation with a note ID, a client
generated operation ID, a base version, and a timestamp, and the Sync Engine
applies operations in a total order per note. The server assigns a global
monotonic version to each accepted operation, which becomes the watermark every
device uses to know what it still needs to fetch.

Delta sync is what keeps this cheap. Instead of re-downloading a note body on
every change, the client uploads only the changed fields, and the server stores
the current state plus a compact operation log. When a device comes online, it
sends its last-seen version per note and receives only the deltas after that
point. Batching and pipelining matter on mobile networks, where round trips are
expensive; a sync session can carry hundreds of deltas in one request.
Backpressure is handled by chunking large sync responses so a phone on a slow
connection does not time out.

The server must be careful about what it promises. Per-note ordering is
guaranteed, but cross-note ordering is not; a note's version is independent of
every other note, which lets sync parallelize across notes. Deletion sync uses
tombstones so a delete on one device propagates to all devices instead of
resurrecting. Finally, the server exposes a push signal, usually over a
WebSocket, telling a device that new changes are waiting, while polling remains
as the fallback. This combination keeps latency low and correctness high, even
when a user has a notebook with thousands of notes across five devices.

### Q3. How do you handle offline edits and conflict resolution?

Offline editing means two devices can edit the same note without knowing about
each other, so conflicts are guaranteed to happen and must resolve without data
loss. The client is optimistic: an edit is applied locally immediately, and the
operation is queued for upload. When connectivity returns, the client sends its
queued operations to the server, which checks each one against the current
version. If the base version matches, the operation applies cleanly. If not, the
server detects a conflict and must decide what happens next.

The resolution strategy is last-writer-wins with a merge assist. For different
fields of the note, such as title and body, the engine merges automatically,
keeping the newer field value for each field independently. For same-field
edits, the server applies the operation with the higher clock value and records
the loser as an earlier revision, so nothing is destroyed. Logical clocks avoid
the wall-clock skew problem: each device tracks a counter that increments on
every edit, and the tuple of device ID and counter orders concurrent edits
deterministically, even when clocks on two phones disagree.

The tricky part is that users edit the same sentence on two devices, and neither
side should be silently discarded. The app therefore surfaces conflicts that
touched the same region: it shows a banner with the other version, lets the user
pick or merge manually, and stores the result as a new operation. Conflict
history is preserved per note so a user can recover from a bad merge. Storage
rules keep this bounded: the server retains a limited revision window per note,
and the sync log is compacted once a device acknowledges, so the system never
grows without bound.

### Q4. How do you implement full-text search over notes?

Full-text search over notes is the retrieval mechanism that justifies the whole
product, so it must be fast, fresh, and tokenized well. Each note becomes a
search document containing title, body, tags, and attachment text where
extractable. A text analysis pipeline normalizes the content: it lower cases,
splits into tokens, removes stop words, and applies stemming so searches for
"running" match "run". The indexer consumes the note change stream, so a note is
searchable within seconds of an edit. Because a user's notes can number in the
tens of thousands, the index is sharded by user, keeping every query scoped to a
single shard.

Query matching combines lexical and semantic signals. Exact tokens and phrases
match with high weight, while a semantic layer using embeddings catches intent:
a search for "meeting notes from March" should surface the note titled "Q1
planning" even with no shared tokens. The two result sets are merged and
re-ranked by a small model that blends text relevance, recency, tag match, and
click history. Tag filters and notebook filters narrow results, and the query
parser compiles user syntax such as notebook:work into the index query plan.

Freshness has to beat expectation. The search index is updated from the sync
event stream, with a per-user cursor so retries are safe, and a short
time-to-live cache on frequent searches absorbs repeat queries. When an indexed
attachment is deleted, the same stream removes it. The index is finally a
privacy boundary: documents are only ever retrieved through user-scoped queries,
and any sharing permission change triggers an immediate update of the document's
access scope, so a note shared with you today and unshared tomorrow cannot leak
through a stale index entry.

### Q5. How do you handle attachments and media?

Attachments stretch a notes app beyond text into a media library. The attachment
store is object storage, addressed by a content hash or UUID, with metadata kept
in the relational database: owner, note association, MIME type, size, and
processing state. When a user attaches an image, the app uploads it directly to
a pre-signed URL to avoid funneling large files through the API gateway, then
records the attachment reference in the note. The hash-based addressing gives
deduplication: the same photo attached to three notes is stored once, and only
the reference rows differ.

Media needs processing pipelines. Images get thumbnails and resized variants for
fast grid rendering, audio recordings get waveform previews, and PDFs get page
thumbnails and text extraction for search. These run as asynchronous workers
driven by a job queue, because transcoding an hour of audio cannot block a note
save. The note record stores the base attachment plus the derived variants as a
list, and the client picks the smallest variant that fits the current screen. A
CDN fronts the object store so shared and hot media load quickly from the edge.

Storage and sync are the governance problems. Attachments are excluded from the
delta sync stream; a note syncs its attachment references and metadata, while
the bytes move only when the user opens them. This keeps sync fast and mobile
plans intact. Quotas are enforced at upload time per user tier, and a garbage
collector removes orphaned objects whose reference rows no longer exist, with a
grace period for sync in flight. Retention policy lets users offload large media
to cold storage automatically. The design accepts that attachments are heavy,
and optimizes around keeping the common path of note text light and instant.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a distributed cache (Redis-like)

A distributed cache sits between applications and the source of truth to turn
slow, per-request DB reads into sub-millisecond memory reads. The architecture
is a cluster of cache nodes sharded by key: a client-side consistent-hash ring
or a proxy routes each key to the node owning its hash slot, and every node
holds its shard in memory. The data model matters: Redis-style caches support
strings, hashes, sorted sets, and lists, so you can cache JSON documents,
counters, sets of IDs, and ranked lists instead of opaque blobs. Every entry
carries a `TTL`, so stale data eventually expires even if explicit invalidation
is missed.

The request flow is cache-aside: the application reads from the cache; on a hit
it's done; on a miss it loads from the source DB and writes the value back for
future reads. Concurrency is handled with atomic primitives — `SETNX` for
single-writer semantics, Lua scripts for multi-step check-and-set, and
`INCR`/`DECR` for counters — so parallel writers can't corrupt state. Scaling is
horizontal: add nodes and rehash, using virtual nodes so only a fraction of keys
move on each change; availability is handled by replicating each shard (replicas
serve reads) and by falling back to the source DB when a cache node is down,
degrading performance rather than correctness.

Memory is finite, so eviction and admission policy are first-class concerns:
`maxmemory` plus an LRU/LFU/random eviction policy decides what is dropped under
pressure, and hot data should be pinned or given longer TTLs. Persistence is a
trade-off — `AOF` (append-only file) recovers more recent writes at a latency
cost, `RDB` snapshots are cheaper but lose the last interval — and for a cache,
losing everything and refilling from the source is often the cheapest failure
mode. A monitor tracks hit rate, evictions, latency percentiles, and per-shard
skew so you can right-size the cluster before users feel it.

### Q2. Cache-aside vs write-through: which do you use?

Cache-aside (lazy loading): the application reads from the cache, and on a miss
loads from the DB and populates the cache, usually with a TTL. Writes go only to
the DB; the cache is invalidated on write or left to expire. Pros: the cache
holds only hot data, memory is used efficiently, the write path pays no cache
cost, and the DB remains the single source of truth — a wrong cache entry is
merely slow, never incorrect. Cons: the first read after a miss is slow (cache
warming), and staleness persists until invalidation or TTL expiry, so a recently
updated row can serve old data for up to the TTL.

Write-through: every write goes through the cache, which writes the value to the
DB before acknowledging, so the cache always holds the latest value and reads
almost never miss. The cost is that every write pays the DB latency on the
critical path, cold data gets cached and wastes memory, and if the DB is down
the write fails even though the cache could have served it. Write-behind loosens
that: the cache acknowledges immediately and persists asynchronously through a
queue, which makes writes fast but risks losing acknowledged writes if a node
crashes before flush — so you pair it with a durable queue and retries.

Recommendation: cache-aside with TTLs for read-heavy workloads where write
latency matters and reads are what you optimize; write-through when the cache is
effectively the read model and you need strong freshness or want reads to never
warm up; write-behind for high-volume write streams where you can tolerate a
small loss window in exchange for speed. In practice you combine them:
cache-aside for general reads, an invalidation channel that deletes on write so
updates propagate quickly, and a reserved write-behind path for counters and
event-style writes where freshness within seconds is acceptable.

### Q3. How do you invalidate cache entries consistently?

Invalidation is where caches go wrong. The simplest mechanism is TTL: entries
expire after a fixed window, giving bounded staleness with zero coordination —
but you accept a delay between a DB update and the refreshed cache. For prompt
propagation, publish an invalidation event: after a successful DB write, the
source emits a delete for the affected keys to a channel (Redis pub/sub, Kafka,
or a CDC stream) that all cache nodes subscribe to. Delete, don't overwrite:
deleting is idempotent and safe, because a concurrent stale write can't clobber
a newer value the way a stale `SET` can; the next read repopulates from the
current DB state.

Ordering is the failure mode. A reader that misses, fetches an old value from a
replica, and writes it back just after the invalidation has reintroduced a stale
entry — the classic read/update race. Counter it by storing versioned values and
using compare-and-set (e.g., a Lua script that only sets if the stored version
is older), so a stale writer is rejected; or, simpler, avoid write-on-read after
a recent invalidation and let the TTL clean up. The cleanest source of
invalidation events is a change-data-capture stream from the DB's binlog,
because it also captures updates that bypass the application code.

Under write-heavy load, per-key deletes can become an invalidation storm, and a
miss storm follows — all readers of a deleted key hit the source at once.
Mitigate with jittered TTLs as a backstop, coalescing invalidation events on the
bus (one delete per key per window), and rate limiting the invalidation channel.
Accept that cache consistency is best-effort: combine TTL as the safety net, an
at-least-once idempotent invalidation channel for promptness, versioned CAS
writes to kill the read/update race, and a design that always falls back to the
source of truth when correctness demands it.

### Q4. How do you handle cache stampedes and hot keys?

A cache stampede (thundering herd) hits when a hot key's entry expires and
thousands of concurrent requests miss together, then all load from the source
and repopulate. Mitigations: single-flight/request coalescing — one in-flight
loader per key, and every other request awaits the same future, implemented with
a per-key mutex map or Redis locking; jittered TTLs so entries never expire in
lockstep; stale-while-revalidate, serving the stale value while a background
task refreshes so reads never block; and refresh-ahead, where a worker
proactively recomputes just before expiry for expensive keys. All of these trade
a little extra CPU for collapsing thousands of DB calls into one.

Hot keys are a different failure: a single key with disproportionate traffic is
owned by exactly one shard, so even a healthy cluster forms a hotspot and one
node saturates while the rest idle. Options: replicate the hot key to several
nodes under variant keys (`key`, `key:1`, `key:2`) so reads fan out across
shards — writes must update every copy, so keep the replica count small; split
the key into sub-keys (`user:42:{0..N}`) hashed across the ring and merge on
read; or push the hot value into a small in-process local cache on every
application node with a short TTL, which is how the largest hot keys are often
served.

Treat hot keys as an operational problem: a monitor that tracks per-key request
rates and per-shard latency skew will catch a hotspot before the pager does. On
detection, promote the key to the fan-out or local-cache strategy, then demote
when traffic recedes. The trade-off across strategies is consistency — every
extra copy multiplies write cost and invalidation fan-out — so hot-key handling
should be policy-driven and reversible, with the source DB always able to absorb
the fallback load if a cache node dies.

### Q5. How do you ensure consistency between cache and source of truth?

The cache is a denormalized copy, so its consistency is bounded. Under normal
cache-aside operation with invalidation, staleness is bounded by the TTL and the
invalidation channel latency. The correctness property you want is eventual
consistency in the right direction: after the DB commits a write, any cache
entry for that key must eventually reflect the new value or be absent. Make the
invalidation event at-least-once and idempotent (a delete is idempotent), and
publish it on the same stream as the DB commit — a change-data-capture stream
from the binlog is cleanest, because it also catches updates that bypass the
application.

The hard cases are races and crashes. A reader repopulating from a stale DB
snapshot, or a DB write that fails after partial invalidation, can re-introduce
staleness. Use versioned entries with CAS, accept a small staleness window, and
treat the cache as disposable — any node can drop and rebuild it. For
read-your-writes consistency, route reads of recently written keys directly to
the source, or use read-through against a replicated read replica. In short: TTL
for bounded staleness, binlog-driven invalidation for promptness, and a design
that never lets the cache block correctness.

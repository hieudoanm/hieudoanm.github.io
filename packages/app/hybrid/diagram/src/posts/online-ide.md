## Answers

### Q1. Design an online IDE

An online IDE replaces a local development machine with a browser experience.
When a developer opens a project, the workspace service allocates an isolated
environment, the editor backend serves the editing session, and an execution
proxy runs commands and streams terminal output back to the browser. Builds and
file persistence are handled by dedicated services, and session state tracks
where each developer left off. The result must feel like a local editor even
though all compute happens in a datacenter.

The diagram shows the main flow. The developer connects through the gateway,
which asks the workspace service to allocate a workspace, and the workspace
service creates a sandbox from a pool of pre-warmed environments. The editor
backend handles file edits, the execution proxy routes run commands into the
sandbox and streams output, and builds are dispatched to a separate build
service. Workspace files are persisted to a file store, and metadata such as the
project and last session lands in the workspaces database.

The defining constraint is latency to the user's keystrokes and the runtime.
Keystroke-to-preview latency must stay low even though editor logic runs in the
browser and execution runs in a container possibly thousands of miles away. The
design therefore separates the frontend editor, which renders and handles local
interactions instantly, from the backend that provides language services and
execution, communicating over persistent WebSockets that compress traffic
heavily. The design also degrades gracefully: when the backend connection drops,
the editor keeps accepting keystrokes locally and reconciles on reconnect, so a
network blip never loses a user's work.

### Q2. How do you manage isolated execution environments?

Isolation is achieved with per-user containers or lightweight virtual machines
so that one user's code, and especially one user's malicious or memory-hungry
code, cannot affect another. Each environment is single-tenant: the sandbox
carries the user's files, runtime toolchains, and secrets, and it has network,
CPU, memory, and storage quotas enforced by the host. Untrusted code runs inside
the sandbox with no ability to reach the control plane or other users, and
network egress is restricted to what the workload needs.

Startup latency is the enemy, so the sandbox service maintains a pool of
pre-warmed environments. Idle sandboxes boot their base image in advance, and
when a user connects, the workspace service clones a warm sandbox, attaches the
user's files, and hands out the connection. This brings time-to-first-key down
from minutes to seconds. Long-running environments are suspended when idle and
resumed on demand, trading memory for startup cost.

Sandboxes are ephemeral and cheap to recreate. Because persistence lives in a
separate file store, a sandbox can be destroyed and rebuilt without losing work,
which keeps the pool self-healing: crashed, leaked, or abandoned environments
are reaped by a scheduler. Resource abuse is bounded by per-workspace quotas and
automatic suspension, and the whole fleet is watched for anomalies. A leaked
sandbox is bad, so environments are also given a hard lifetime and rotated
regularly even when healthy. A per-workspace audit trail records when an
environment was created, accessed, and destroyed, which matters for security
reviews and for understanding the cost of the sandbox fleet.

### Q3. How do you stream edits and terminal output?

Edits flow over a persistent duplex connection between the browser and the
editor backend. The frontend editor captures keystrokes, applies them locally
for instant rendering, and sends the changes to the backend over WebSocket. The
backend applies them to the shared filesystem and notifies language services and
any other connected clients, such as a pair-programming partner. Optimistic
updates plus conflict detection, using operation transforms or document
versions, keep the local view correct when two sources modify the same file.

Terminal output has different requirements. Commands produce unbounded,
high-frequency output, so the execution proxy sends a continuous stream of
terminal frames over a separate channel with backpressure: if the browser cannot
keep up, the proxy coalesces frames rather than queueing forever. The protocol
is message-based with buffering on the client, and reconnection logic replays
missed output so a dropped connection does not lose terminal history. Input,
such as keystrokes to a running process, rides the same channel in the reverse
direction.

Streaming infrastructure must be observable and cheap. Every connection carries
heartbeat and latency telemetry, and backpressure at the browser, proxy, and
process levels prevents one chatty process from exhausting memory. The proxy is
stateful per connection, so reconnects must map to the same underlying process,
typically by keeping a sticky mapping from session to execution environment.
Logs are aggregated out-of-band so a user's terminal session is not the only
record of what ran. Output from builds and long-running commands is also
persisted to a log store, so a user who closes the tab can still retrieve the
tail of what their process printed.

### Q4. How do you scale cloud builds?

Builds are resource-hungry and bursty, so they are decoupled from the
interactive sandbox. When the user asks to build or test, the build service
takes a snapshot of the workspace, dispatches the work to a pool of dedicated
build workers, and streams progress back to the IDE. Workers are ephemeral and
stateless beyond the build, so the pool scales in and out with demand, and the
interactive workspace is never starved by a compile. Build caching, by
dependency and by source hash, is the main lever for making repeated builds
fast.

The build pipeline is queued and parallelized. A queue absorbs bursts from many
users, and a scheduler splits a build into stages that can run across workers,
for example compiling independent modules concurrently. Because builds can be
cancelled, the scheduler tracks each job's state and reclaims workers promptly
when the user stops the build. Pre-built dependency caches and warm worker
images avoid reinstalling the same toolchain for every build.

Scaling is governed by admission control. A global concurrency limit caps active
builds, and queued builds are ordered by priority so interactive builds beat
background ones. Per-user and per-org quotas prevent a single account from
consuming the whole fleet, and builds that exceed resource budgets are killed
with a clear error. The build results, logs, and artifacts are persisted, so a
build that ran once can be replayed or inspected without re-executing the
compiler. The build service also records build duration, cache hit rate, and
queue wait per project, so teams can see when their builds are slow and whether
caching is actually helping.

### Q5. How do you persist user workspaces?

Persistence is split from compute. Workspace files live in a content-addressable
file store keyed by snapshot, while the workspaces database records metadata
such as the project, the owning user, the last opened session, and where each
snapshot is stored. The sandbox mounts the file store at startup and flushes
changes back on a schedule and on shutdown, so a destroyed sandbox can be
recreated with the user's exact files. The file store is the single source of
truth that survives every environment churn.

Writes are incremental, not wholesale. The editor sends change notifications
that the workspace service batches into commits, and each commit produces a new
snapshot with a manifest of changed files. This keeps persistence cheap for
large repositories because only diffs are transferred, and it enables
versioning, so a user can roll back to an earlier snapshot. Consistency is
eventual but bounded: the durability promise is that every acknowledged edit is
safely persisted, and in-flight edits on a crashed sandbox are recovered on
reconnect or surfaced as a conflict.

Multi-user and lifecycle concerns shape the data model. When a team works in the
same workspace, a merge strategy reconciles concurrent edits, and access control
on the workspace governs who may open or modify it. Idle workspaces are
suspended and their sandboxes reclaimed, but their files are untouched.
Retention policies handle storage growth, and export gives the user a tarball of
their work at any time, so no customer is ever locked into a workspace they
cannot take home.

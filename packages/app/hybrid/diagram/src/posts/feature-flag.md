- How do you implement gradual rollouts and targeting?
- How do you avoid cache stampedes on flag changes?
- How do you audit who changed what and when?

## Answers

### Q1. Design a feature flag service

A feature flag service answers one question very fast: is this flag enabled for
this user? The app SDK calls a flag API with a flag key and a context (user ID,
group, device, country), and the API evaluates the flag's rules and returns a
boolean or a typed variant. Flags live in a flag store — a relational or KV
database holding every flag's default state, rollout percentage, targeting
rules, and per-environment overrides. A rollout engine and a targeting evaluator
implement the rules, while a flag cache keeps hot evaluations off the database
and makes the read path cost microseconds rather than milliseconds.

Around that evaluation core sit three supporting planes. A control plane — the
admin UI plus the rollout engine — lets engineers create, edit, and promote
flags. An audit log records every change with actor and timestamp so "who
changed what and when" is always answerable. A usage-metrics plane counts
evaluations per flag and per route, so operators see which flags are hot and
whether evaluation latency degrades. Change propagation runs through the cache
plus a pub/sub channel that pushes invalidations to clients, so a flag flip
reaches the fleet in seconds instead of minutes. Because every application
request may depend on a flag, the service must be ultra-available, low-latency,
and carefully monitored. Flags are organized per environment, so the same key
can hold independent state in development, staging, and production, and a
promote action copies the reviewed state forward while recording it in the audit
log.

### Q2. How do you evaluate flags with low latency?

The evaluation path must stay off the database. The SDK keeps a local cache of
flag rules and evaluates them client-side, so a flag check is a hash lookup with
zero network round trips — this is the standard approach for mature flag
services. On a cold start, or when the SDK is too constrained to cache, the
evaluation goes to the flag API, which serves a bulk snapshot of all flag
configurations for the environment from an in-memory cache. Server-side
evaluation (for APIs without an SDK) reads the same snapshot and runs the same
deterministic evaluator, so client and server never disagree about a flag's
value.

Rules are compiled into a compact decision tree or an ordered condition list, so
evaluation is a sequence of cheap comparisons rather than queries or joins. The
flag API is stateless and scales horizontally; the only shared state is the
snapshot cache, which is either sharded or replicated in-process per node.
Determinism is a correctness property, not a performance nicety: the same
context must yield the same result on any node, so evaluation is a pure function
of context plus a version-stamped snapshot. Request timeouts are short, and a
flag outage degrades to the configured default-on or default-off fallback rather
than blocking the caller — flag evaluation must never be a source of latency or
outage for the applications that depend on it. Batch evaluation exists too:
callers that need many flags, such as feature-gating a whole page, request a map
of flag values in a single call, and the SDK caches the batch alongside
individual evaluations.

### Q3. How do you implement gradual rollouts and targeting?

A gradual rollout is a percentage gate layered on the rule evaluation. The
engine hashes a stable identifier from the context — normally a user or session
ID — to a value in [0, 100), then turns the flag on when the hash falls below
the rollout percentage. Because the hash is deterministic, a user who is on at
50% rollout stays on when the rollout rises to 75%; users are never toggled
backward unless the rollout itself is reduced. This makes rollout a smooth ramp
of the treated population without flapping users between states on every config
change.

Targeting layers on top of the gate with ordered rules: an allowlist for users
who always get the new behavior (employees, QA, specific accounts), segment
rules for country, plan, browser, or cohort, and percentage gates combined with
AND/OR operators. The evaluator walks the rule list in priority order and
returns the first match, which gives flag authors a natural precedence model.
Rules are versioned so an in-flight rollout can be rolled back instantly by
pointing the environment at the previous snapshot. Advanced platforms support
multi-variant flags rather than boolean on/off, so a single rollout can compare
several behaviors; the same hash-and-gate machinery picks the variant, and each
variant can carry its own rollout curve. Rollout safety rails guard the ramp: a
kill-switch flag overrides all others, an approval gate requires sign-off past
50%, and automatic rollback triggers on error-rate or latency regressions
measured in the usage-metrics plane.

### Q4. How do you avoid cache stampedes on flag changes?

Two distinct stampedes matter, and they need different fixes. The first is at
the flag API: a snapshot is invalidated and every request node refetches it
simultaneously, multiplying the load on the flag store by the node count.
Mitigation is request coalescing — only one in-flight fetch per node, with
concurrent callers awaiting the same promise — plus jittered expiry so caches on
different nodes do not expire in lockstep. Stale snapshots remain servable
during a refetch, so a fetch failure serves the previous version instead of
erroring, which turns cache refetch into a background event rather than a
correctness-critical path.

The second stampede is in the SDK fleet: when a flag flips to 100%, every client
must learn about it, and pushing the change to every SDK would itself be a
thundering herd. The service therefore uses a pull model with short polling, or
a fan-out pub/sub channel that carries only a version counter, not the flag
data. Each SDK compares the version and refetches the snapshot only when its
local copy is stale, and refetches are staggered with jitter so the fleet does
not request in sync. The end result is bounded: a flag change propagates across
the fleet in seconds while peak refetch load stays a small multiple of the
steady-state rate — the system never turns one config edit into a self-inflicted
denial of service. Capacity planning bounds the storm further: the flag store is
sized for the refetch peak, and the pub/sub channel is monitored for lag so a
propagation backlog is visible before it causes stale evaluations.

### Q5. How do you audit who changed what and when?

Every mutation to a flag — create, enable, edit rules, change rollout, delete —
flows through the rollout engine, which writes an immutable audit event before
committing the change, so no mutation can silently escape the log. Each event
records the actor (authenticated by the admin UI), the previous and new flag
state, the environment, an optional change reason or ticket link, and a
timestamp. Because the log is append-only, it doubles as a source of truth for
recovery: the current state of any flag can be reconstructed from the last
mutation, and an incident can be answered with "this flag turned on for region X
at 14:32 by user Y" without guesswork.

Audit records are keyed by flag and environment, indexed by time, and retained
for compliance windows. The same log powers safety features: diff views show
exactly which rule changed, release pipelines can gate a promotion on approvals
recorded in the log, and risky flags can require two-person approval that is
written into the same trail. Because the audit write is on the mutation path
rather than async, there is a small write-cost per flag change, which is the
accepted price of a guarantee that every change is attributable. This makes the
audit log both a compliance artifact and the operational backstop for debugging
rollout incidents. Retention is tiered: hot audit events live in a fast store
for interactive querying while older records archive to object storage,
preserving the trail at low cost for the full compliance horizon.

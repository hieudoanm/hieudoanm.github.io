- How do you handle resend and expiry?

## Answers

### Q1. Design a one-time password service

A one-time password service generates a short-lived secret, delivers it to a
user through some out-of-band channel, and then validates the code the user
returns before allowing a sensitive operation such as login or a transaction.
The core components are a code generator, a delivery layer that talks to SMS and
email providers, a verification service that checks submitted codes, and a rate
limiter that protects every stage of the flow. All activity is written to an
audit log so that abuse and delivery failures can be investigated later. The OTP
store holds the code, its hash, the target identifier, an expiry timestamp, and
the number of failed attempts.

The flow starts when the client requests a code. The gateway forwards the
request to the OTP service, which asks the generator for a fresh code, checks
the rate limiter, and hands the code to the delivery service for transmission
over the chosen channel. When the user enters a code, the gateway routes it to
the verification service, which compares the submission against the stored,
hashed value and returns an accept or reject decision. Because codes are
single-use, a successful verification must atomically invalidate the code so
that replaying it fails.

The critical concerns are security and abuse resistance. Codes must be
cryptographically random, never stored in plaintext, and valid for only a few
minutes. Every endpoint needs rate limiting, because the same identifier can be
used to hammer delivery costs or brute force a code. The system must also
tolerate channel failure gracefully: if the SMS provider is down, delivery
should retry, fall back to email, or surface a controlled error instead of
leaving the user stuck with a silent failure.

### Q2. How do you generate secure OTP codes?

The generator should use a cryptographically secure random number source, never
a predictable seed such as a timestamp or a counter. For numeric codes of six
digits, you derive the value from secure random bytes and reject any value
outside the valid range so the distribution stays uniform. Storing only a salted
hash of the code rather than the plaintext limits the damage if the store is
breached, though it does complicate hashing of numeric codes, which have low
entropy and are easy to brute force offline unless a per-code random salt is
used.

You should also keep the same code unique across delivery attempts so that a
repeated request produces a different value. This prevents an attacker from
pre-empting a resend to see the old value echoed back. Codes must be
short-lived; a typical time-to-live is three to five minutes, which balances
usability against the window an attacker has to guess. Store the expiry with the
hash and have the verification path reject any code older than the TTL. Record
the generation timestamp and chosen channel alongside the code so support can
diagnose a late delivery, and treat a code that was requested but never
acknowledged by the provider as a distinct state in monitoring.

Finally, generation must be coupled to rate limiting. Without a cap on how many
codes can be generated per identifier per hour, an attacker can repeatedly
trigger deliveries, exhausting your messaging budget or annoying the user, and
each code gives them another guessing attempt. A per-identifier and per-IP
budget is checked before generation and before delivery so that both the
generator and the messaging channel are protected.

### Q3. How do you deliver codes across channels?

Delivery is abstracted behind a channel interface so the same code can go out
over SMS, email, push, or a voice call. Each channel is backed by one or more
providers with their own quirks: SMS has strict per-number and per-shortcode
throughput limits, email is cheap but slow and can land in spam, and push
requires a registered device token. The delivery service picks a channel based
on availability, cost, user preference, and the sensitivity of the operation,
then records the attempt and its provider response in the audit log.

Reliability matters more than speed for delivery. Provider calls can time out or
return undeliverable, so the send path should be idempotent: re-sending the same
logical attempt must not mint a new code. A retry with exponential backoff and a
provider failover list ensures a code still reaches the user when the primary
carrier is degraded. Delivery confirmation should be asynchronous, with the
provider acknowledgment updating a delivery status table rather than blocking
the request.

Multi-channel support also changes the abuse surface. SMS is expensive and
subject to toll fraud, so the service must enforce hard caps per phone number,
per sender, and globally per window. Email delivery needs sender reputation
management, including warm-up, domain alignment, and bounce handling. The choice
of channel should also be user-confirmable, and any channel-specific identifier,
like a phone number, must be validated and normalized before it is used for
anything. Providers should be treated as untrusted: the service verifies that
the address the code went to matches the one the user registered, and it never
echoes the code back through the same channel it was sent on.

### Q4. How do you prevent brute force?

Brute force protection operates on two fronts: limiting the number of guess
attempts and limiting how many codes can be generated. The verification service
keeps a per-identifier counter of failed attempts, and once the threshold is
reached the code is invalidated and further attempts are rejected until the user
starts a fresh flow. The limiter also caps codes per identifier and per client
IP per hour so an attacker cannot simply reissue codes to get new guesses at a
cheap rate.

Sliding-window rate limiting, implemented in a fast in-memory store such as
Redis with keys that expire, handles the hot path with low latency, while a
durable counter in the OTP store provides an authoritative backstop for
accounting. Because both the generation and verification paths are throttled, an
attacker cannot amplify a single compromised channel into unbounded guessing.
Lockout events and the client IP should be written to the audit log so patterns
can be detected across many accounts. The limiter should budget SMS, email, and
verification separately, because an attacker who exhausts one channel should not
gain headroom in another.

Defense-in-depth matters even when guessing is slow. Codes should be useless
once the TTL expires, so the guessing window is bounded. For high-value
operations the system can require a second factor, delay verification behind a
CAPTCHA after repeated failures, or force a cooldown before the next code can be
requested. Since numeric codes are only six digits of entropy, the real
protection is the combination of short expiry, attempt limits, and throttling,
not the length of the code itself.

### Q5. How do you handle resend and expiry?

Resend is the most abused operation in an OTP service, so it must be gated by
its own rate limits, separate from generation and verification. Each resend
should reuse the same logical request but must never reuse the same code, to
avoid the "I know the old value" attack. If the original delivery actually
succeeded, a resend is wasted cost; if it failed, the service should prefer to
retry the failed channel or fail over to another before minting a new send.

Expiry is enforced in both the data and the validation paths. Every stored code
carries a TTL, and verification rejects codes that have lapsed regardless of
whether the user typed them correctly. A background sweep, or lazy expiration on
read, removes stale rows so the store does not grow without bound. When a code
expires, the user must be able to request a new one, which again goes through
the generator and the rate limiter.

The user experience around expiry should be explicit and recoverable. If the
user submits an expired code, the response should distinguish "wrong code" from
"code expired" so the client can trigger a resend automatically instead of
asking the user to retype. State transitions, including every resend, delivery
ack, expiry, and verification, belong in the audit log, which also gives
operations a trail for debugging why a particular user never received their
code. The log should record the reason for every resend and expiry event, so
support has a complete picture when a user reports a code that silently never
arrived.

Package publish, dependency resolution, downloads.

## Interview Questions

- Design a package registry
- How do you store and serve package versions?
- How do you resolve dependency trees?
- How do you protect against supply chain attacks?
- How do you handle hot downloads?

## Answers

### Q1. Design a package registry

A package registry stores distributable packages and serves them to tools like
npm, pip, and cargo during installs. The write path is publish: a developer
submits a tarball through the gateway, it is scanned for security issues, stored
durably, indexed for search, and recorded in the registry database. The read
path is install: a client asks for a dependency tree, the resolver computes the
exact versions to fetch, and the package store serves the tarballs, ideally from
a fast cache.

The diagram captures both paths. Publish flows from the developer through the
gateway to a security scan; only an allowed package proceeds to the store and
search index. Install starts with the client asking the gateway to resolve a
tree, the resolver walks dependencies against the package store, and downloads
are served from a cache. The registry database is the source of truth for
metadata, while the blob store holds the actual package contents.

The dominant engineering constraints are read throughput and correctness of
resolution. Install tools hammer the registry with metadata requests, often for
tiny metadata files, so a cache in front of the metadata store absorbs most
traffic. Dependency resolution must be deterministic and reproducible, which
means version ranges, semver rules, and lockfile compatibility all have to be
handled exactly, and any ambiguity surfaces as broken builds for millions of
developers. The registry must also stay compatible with ecosystem semantics,
such as dist-tags and version ranges, because tools depend on behaviors that
clients have learned to expect over years.

### Q2. How do you store and serve package versions?

Each package version is a logical unit with two parts: metadata, such as the
manifest, description, and dependency ranges, and a tarball of the code. The
metadata lives in a structured store that supports fast, point lookups by
package name and version, while the tarball lives in an immutable blob store
addressed by a content hash. Immutability is a correctness requirement: once a
version is published it must never change, because builds replay the exact bytes
that produced a given hash.

Serving separates hot from cold data. The blob store handles high-volume
downloads with CDNs and edge caching, and metadata is served through a
read-through cache so that the most popular requests never touch the database.
Version lists for a package, which can be long for popular libraries, are
compacted and cached as single records. Deprecated and unpublished versions are
recorded as tombstone metadata so the client is told the version no longer
exists instead of getting a generic failure. Large tarballs are served as
streams with ranged requests and checksums verified on the fly, so a client can
resume an interrupted download without starting over.

Consistency between metadata and blobs matters during publish. The registry
commits metadata only after the blob is durably stored, so an install can never
resolve a version whose bytes are missing. On the read side, the design
tolerates eventual consistency for search indexes but keeps the resolution path
strongly consistent, because a resolver seeing two different answers for the
same request is one of the worst failure modes a package manager can produce.

### Q3. How do you resolve dependency trees?

Resolution starts from a root manifest that lists direct dependencies, often
with semver ranges rather than exact versions. The resolver asks the registry
for the available versions of each dependency, applies the range constraints,
and picks versions that are mutually compatible, which is the hard part:
transitive dependencies can conflict, and different package managers choose
different strategies, from nesting to flat deduplication, for reconciling them.
The output is a concrete tree that can be written to a lockfile and replayed
deterministically.

The resolver must be efficient against a real registry. For every resolution it
issues version-metadata lookups, often in parallel, and each lookup can chain
further resolvable dependencies, so a naive implementation can explode into
thousands of requests. Caching metadata, batching lookups, and reusing
previously resolved subtrees keep resolution fast, while a well-known-satisfier
approach solves the constraint-satisfaction problem in one pass rather than
backtracking combinatorially.

Correctness wins over cleverness. The same input must produce the same tree, and
resolution must respect peer dependencies, engines, and platform tags without
silently violating them. Lockfiles make installs reproducible, so the registry
supports returning the exact versions a lockfile pins. When a range is
unsatisfiable, the error should name the conflicting constraints, because
helpful diagnostics prevent a huge share of developer frustration and support
tickets. Resolution also has to cope with unpublished versions: a version that
was removed must still resolve from a lockfile until a defined cutoff, otherwise
historical builds break silently. The registry therefore keeps tombstones for
unpublished versions and returns explicit deprecation metadata to clients that
request them.

### Q4. How do you protect against supply chain attacks?

The publish path is the trust boundary. Every submission passes through a
security scan that checks for known malware patterns, dangerous install scripts,
suspicious network activity, and typo-squatted names that mimic popular
packages. Package names are reserved or reviewed to prevent confusable
registrations, and strong authentication, such as scoped tokens and two-factor
or hardware-key enforcement for popular packages, gates who can publish. The
scan result is recorded and a failed scan blocks publication.

Provenance and integrity protect consumers. Each published tarball is
content-addressed and signed, and the signature chain points back to the
publishing identity, so consumers can verify that the bytes they download are
exactly what was published. Organizations can adopt allowlisting and
dependency-approval workflows where the registry acts as a proxy that only
resolves packages on an approved list. Reproducible builds and post-publish
scanning catch malicious changes that slip in through compromised maintainer
accounts.

Detection and response close the loop. The registry monitors for anomalous
publish activity, such as a sudden flood of releases from a legitimate account,
and can quarantine packages when malware is reported after the fact. When a
malicious package is found, the response is a coordinated takedown plus a
notification push to affected consumers through the registry metadata itself.
The audit queue records every publish, deprecation, and deletion so a compromise
can be reconstructed and attributed. The response is also transparent: when a
package is removed, the community should see why, so a takedown never looks
arbitrary and consumers can react deliberately.

### Q5. How do you handle hot downloads?

Hot downloads concentrate on a small number of popular packages that can see
millions of requests per day, so the serving path must avoid hitting a single
database. The first line of defense is a CDN and edge cache: tarballs are
content-addressed and immutable, so they are trivially cacheable with long TTLs,
and metadata records are cached with short TTLs that honor the publish-time
invalidation. A read-through cache in front of the metadata store absorbs the
long tail of repeated version queries.

The cache must handle thundering-herd behavior. When a package releases a new
version, thousands of CI systems may request the new metadata simultaneously; if
each request misses the cache and hits the database, the registry can be
overwhelmed. The design uses request coalescing, where a single upstream request
fills the cache and concurrent requests wait for it, plus prefetching of
just-published metadata so the first wave of requests hits a warm cache.
Backpressure and queuing protect the database from bursts.

Download accounting itself is a scaling problem. Every tarball fetch and
metadata request is logged for analytics, and these logs alone can dwarf the
actual serving load, so tracking is decoupled onto a queue and processed
asynchronously rather than synchronously in the hot path. Capacity planning is
driven by real traffic: the registry publishes which versions are popular, and
the team uses that data to ensure the cache fleet and CDN distribution are
provisioned for the spike profile of a major release.

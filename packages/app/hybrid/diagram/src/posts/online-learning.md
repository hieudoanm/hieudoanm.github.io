## Answers

### Q1. Design an online learning platform

An online learning platform delivers structured courses, tracks each learner's
progress, grades assessments, and issues credentials. The learner interacts
through the Learning App, which routes requests through the API Gateway. The
Course Service owns the catalog, enrollments, and course structure, while the
Video Platform streams recorded lessons. As a student watches and completes
items, the Progress Tracker records milestones that drive what the app offers
next. Quizzes are managed by the Quiz Engine and graded by the Grading Service,
and when a course is completed, the Certificate Service issues a verifiable
credential and the Notification Service emails the student. Enrollments and
progress records live in the Enrollments DB.

The three pillars, content delivery, progress tracking, and assessment, have
very different requirements. Video is a read-heavy delivery problem that demands
a CDN and bandwidth planning. Progress is a write-heavy consistency problem,
since every pause, resume, and completion is an event that must be recorded
durably and reflected immediately in the UI. Assessment is a correctness and
fairness problem, with the added requirement that grades and certificates must
be tamper-evident. Keeping these as separate services lets each scale and fail
independently, which matters because a video outage is annoying but a grading
outage is unacceptable.

The learner's experience depends on the platform knowing exactly where they are,
on any device, at any moment. That makes progress the connective tissue of the
system, feeding the course map, the certificate eligibility check, and the
resume-watching feature. The design therefore treats progress writes as
first-class, idempotent events and makes the progress read path fast with
caching, so the course interface always reflects the latest state without
overloading the database.

### Q2. How do you stream video lessons at scale?

Video is the dominant bandwidth cost, and the architecture is built around
encoding and delivery rather than storage. When a lesson is published, it is
transcoded into multiple renditions, from low-bitrate mobile to high- definition
desktop, and segmented into short chunks that can be fetched independently. The
Video Platform stores the segments in object storage and fronts them with a CDN,
so the origin is hit only on a cache miss. The player requests a manifest that
lists the renditions and segments, and it switches renditions dynamically based
on measured bandwidth, which keeps playback smooth on flaky connections.

Caching is what makes global scale affordable. A lesson is identical for every
student, so popular content gets enormous cache hit rates at the CDN edge, and
the origin storage cost is paid once while the delivery cost is spread across a
global edge network. Cache control is deliberate: published lessons are
effectively immutable and can be cached aggressively, while re-encoded or
replaced lessons are versioned with new URLs so stale chunks are never served.
The main scaling concern is cold-start, when a freshly published lesson is first
requested worldwide, so the system pre-warms the edge by pushing the segments
out ahead of the launch.

The interactive features are built around the same segments. The player reports
playback positions and pauses to the Progress Tracker, and seek requests map to
segment boundaries so a seek is just fetching from the CDN at a different
offset. Streaming must degrade gracefully under load: when the CDN degrades or a
region is saturated, the player falls back to lower renditions and the platform
can fall back to a second CDN provider. Monitoring is per-region and per-ISP,
because a smooth stream in one region says nothing about another.

### Q3. How do you track learner progress?

Progress is the learner's state machine. The system tracks two levels:
item-level events, such as "watched 80 percent of this video" or "completed this
quiz", and course-level completion, which is derived by aggregating the item
states. The Progress Tracker consumes events from the app, normalizes them, and
writes them as idempotent updates keyed by student and course. Idempotency
matters because the app retries writes and because a student may watch the same
segment on two devices, so the same event must not double- count. Each write
updates both the item state and the precomputed course summary.

Consistency between the write path and the read path is the hard problem. The
student's next-lesson button must reflect their latest state immediately, but
the write volume is enormous, spanning every pause and resume. The design
separates the hot read path from the durable store: the Progress Tracker
maintains a fast in-memory state for active sessions that the app queries
through the gateway, while a committed log drains to the Enrollments DB
asynchronously. On crash recovery, the durable store is the source of truth and
the in-memory state is rebuilt from it, so a transient loss of a session only
delays, never erases, recorded progress.

Progress also defines what the student is allowed to do. Unlocking a quiz until
prerequisite items are complete, marking a module done, and computing course
completion all read the aggregated state. Because progress is event- based, the
system can reprocess history: if completion rules change, for example a lesson
is added, the existing events can be replayed against the new rules to recompute
every affected course state. The aggregated summary is what certificates
consume, so its integrity is treated as a first-class concern.

### Q4. How do you build quizzes and grading?

Quizzes are authored content, like lessons, but they are executed interactively.
The Quiz Engine owns the quiz lifecycle: it serves questions one at a time,
collects answers, and enforces the rules of the assessment, such as time limits,
attempt limits, and whether a student can return to a previous question. The
question bank is versioned with courses, so a change to a question creates a new
version rather than mutating the old one, which is essential for fair retakes
and for auditing. Each quiz attempt creates a session that records every answer
with a timestamp.

Grading is deliberately separated from quizzing. The Grading Service scores an
attempt deterministically: multiple-choice answers map to keys, and
free-response answers are checked by model-based grading or human review.
Deterministic grading is idempotent, so a graded attempt can be recomputed and
the result is always identical, which is a requirement when a student disputes a
score. The grading result updates the attempt record and the course progress in
one atomic step, so a grade and its progress effect cannot disagree. Partial
credit, penalties, and pass thresholds are all configuration on the course,
applied at grading time.

Fairness and integrity shape the design more than raw scale. The system detects
irregular patterns, such as near-identical submissions or answers submitted in
implausibly short times, and flags them for review without disrupting the
student. Retake rules are enforced in the Quiz Engine, which checks attempt
limits before starting a session. Because grades feed certificates, the grading
path is immutable and audited: an attempt, its answer set, the scoring inputs,
and the resulting grade form an append-only record that can be reproduced at any
time.

### Q5. How do you issue certificates?

A certificate is the terminal credential of the course, and its integrity
matters more than its volume. The Certificate Service awards a certificate only
when the aggregated course progress satisfies the completion requirements, so
the eligibility check is a query against the Progress Tracker, not a user-facing
flag that could be spoofed. The award is a one-time, idempotent operation: no
matter how many times the completion condition is observed, exactly one
certificate is issued. Each certificate carries a unique identifier, the student
identity, the course, the completion date, and a cryptographic signature from
the platform.

The signature is what makes the credential verifiable. A signed digest lets any
third party check that a certificate was issued by the platform and was not
tampered with, and the signature is generated by a key held in a secure store
separate from the certificate-serving path. The certificate record is written to
a durable, append-only store at issuance time, which makes the ledger of awards
authoritative even if a rendering system fails. The student-facing PDF or badge
is a presentation of that record, not the record itself, so a corrupted download
can be regenerated without touching the ledger.

Certificate correctness depends on the grading and progress paths feeding it
accurate data. Because an award is derived from course state, the system
disallows retroactive awards when the completion requirements change after a
learner has already passed, except through an explicit, audited exception
process. When a learner is found to have violated assessment integrity, a
revocation flow invalidates the signed record, and verification reflects the
revocation. The Notification Service sends the confirmation email, and the
certificate remains queryable by the learner long after the course retirement,
so the certificate store is designed for permanent retention rather than
eviction.

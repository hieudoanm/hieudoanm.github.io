## Answers

### Q1. Design Reddit / a community forum

Reddit is a collection of subreddits — per-topic communities — each hosting
posts that accrue votes and threaded comments. The API gateway fronts the
read-heavy workload (browse, list posts, render comment threads) and the write
path (submit, vote, comment). The Post Service persists submissions to Posts DB
and streams new posts to the Ranking Worker and Search Service. Votes arrive as
a firehose of small writes sharded by post id; the Ranking Worker periodically
consumes vote deltas and recomputes each post's score, writing the top-N into
the Hot Cache that the browse path reads. Comments are stored adjacent to their
parent post for cheap tree assembly, and the Moderation Service screens new
submissions against spam heuristics before they go fully live.

Scale is dominated by reads: the front page and each subreddit's sorted list are
precomputed, cached lists refreshed every few minutes, so a single request is a
cache hit, not a DB scan. Writes — votes above all — are appended to a durable
log and aggregated asynchronously rather than applied eagerly to the hot path.
Availability matters more than strict consistency here: a slightly stale hot
list is acceptable, so the system uses async reconciliation instead of
transactions. Rough estimates: millions of browse requests per minute, tens of
thousands of vote writes per second during spikes, and comment volume an order
of magnitude below that.

### Q2. How do you model subreddits and posts?

Subreddits are lightweight entities in their own table (id, slug, title,
privacy/NSFW flags, moderator set), so every post carries a `subreddit_id`
foreign key and moderation/membership data is read as a separate lookup. Posts
are the large table: id, author_id, subreddit_id, kind (link/text/image/video),
title, body, created_at, and denormalized `score` / `hot_score` columns that the
ranking worker updates in batches rather than on every vote. The hot listing
path uses a secondary index on `(subreddit_id, created_at)` for pagination and
cache rebuilds, while the live list is served from a per-subreddit sorted set in
Redis.

Because post bodies can be large, the table is vertically split: a slim OLTP row
for ids, score, and timestamps, and full text plus rendered HTML in object
storage or a columnar store. Comments form a tree referencing `post_id` and
`parent_id`, with a materialized path (an ancestor-id array or `ltree`-style
string) so "all descendants of X" is a prefix scan, not a recursive CTE.
Trending needs rolling aggregates of vote deltas, so per-post counters of
time-bucketed up/down deltas live in Redis or a time-series store, letting the
ranker recompute scores without scanning the full vote table.

### Q3. How do you rank content (hot / top / new)?

"New" is trivially `created_at DESC` served from the secondary index. "Top" is
cumulative score over a configurable window — a rolling aggregation of up/down
vote deltas by time bucket. "Hot" is the classic Reddit formula: the score grows
logarithmically with votes and decays with age, e.g. a `sign * log10(|score|)`
term divided by an age penalty that grows with hours since submission, tuned so
a fresh post with a modest vote count can outrank an old one with many. The key
architectural insight is that these lists are precomputed, not computed per
request: the Ranking Worker drains vote deltas from a queue every few minutes,
recomputes hot/top for affected posts, and writes the sorted top-N into the Hot
Cache.

Per-subreddit lists and the global front page are separate cache keys
(`hot:subreddit:{id}`, `hot:global`); pagination uses cursor offsets over the
cached list so users don't observe recompute churn mid-scroll. Trade-offs:
precomputation introduces staleness — a post can reach the front page minutes
after a vote burst — but it keeps the read path at pure cache speed and makes
vote manipulation slower to distort ranking. Small/new subreddits fall back to a
direct DB query over the `(subreddit_id, created_at)` index until their cached
list warms up.

### Q4. Design the comment tree at scale

Comments are append-heavy and read-heavy per post; a single popular post can
accumulate tens of thousands of replies. Model them as a self-referencing table:
(id, post_id, parent_id, author_id, body, created_at, score). To render a full
thread without recursive queries, store a materialized path — an array of
ancestor ids or an `ltree`-style string — so subtree retrieval is a single
prefix scan. Popular post pages serialize the whole comment tree into a
versioned cache entry, invalidated by new comments or vote updates, so the first
render is a cache hit and "load more" fetches collapsed subtrees lazily.

Sort modes (best, top, new, controversial) are per-node scores recomputed by the
worker; the default "best" applies a confidence-style correction (e.g. a Wilson
lower bound) so a 2-vote answer cannot outrank a 1000-vote one. Comment votes
batch through the same delta pipeline as post votes. Persistence: shard the
comment table by `post_id` (hash of post id) so a whole thread lives on one
shard and tree queries stay local; subtree collapse metadata (which replies are
hidden) lives in cache, not the DB. Failure handling: a thread render falls back
to the shard's index with a recursive CTE when the cache is cold, trading
latency for correctness during cache storms.

### Q5. How do you detect vote fraud and spam?

Vote fraud: every user–post vote is recorded idempotently with a unique
`(user_id, post_id)` key and rate-limited per user. The Vote Service appends to
a durable log; a fraud worker correlates signals — same IP/device cluster voting
in lockstep, sudden vote spikes from newly created accounts, instant votes right
after account creation, and per-user voting velocity — using per-account and
per-post aggregate counters in Redis. Suspicious votes are queued for review
instead of being applied to scores immediately, so a coordinated burst cannot
distort the hot ranking before it is inspected.

Spam: the Moderation Service runs heuristics on submissions — URL blacklists,
near-duplicate content detection via SimHash-style fingerprints, known-bad
account lists, and text features — then escalates borderline cases to human
moderators who can remove, ban, or set subreddit rules. Both systems share a
feedback loop: confirmed bans retrain the models, and votes on removed posts are
rescinded by the Ranking Worker. Trade-offs: aggressive filtering reduces spam
but risks false positives and user churn, so most filters emit a review queue
rather than hard deletion; the whole pipeline is async, meaning a post is
visible immediately but its score is only trusted after the fraud check settles.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a time-series database

A time-series database (TSDB) is specialized for a workload that general-purpose
databases handle badly: many sensors or hosts each write small, timestamped
samples continuously, and reads are almost always range queries or aggregations
over a time interval. The write path buffers samples in a queue, groups them per
series in memory, and flushes them into immutable, sorted segment files on disk.
Each segment is written sequentially with no random updates, so writes amortize
into sequential I/O and steady-state write throughput is bounded by disk
bandwidth rather than by random-seek latency. This immutable, append-only design
is the defining architectural choice of every major TSDB.

The read path uses a time index that maps a series identifier to its list of
segments and byte offsets, so a range query seeks directly into the relevant
segments instead of scanning the whole store. A hot cache serves recent segments
and in-memory buffers, while a downsampler compacts older segments into
lower-resolution summaries. Because data is immutable, the TSDB never updates in
place: compaction rewrites old segments, and deletes become tombstones that are
reclaimed during compaction. Label and series indexes round out the model,
letting a query resolve "host=prod and metric=cpu" to a small set of series IDs
before touching data — the same segment-plus-index-plus-compaction skeleton
appears in Prometheus, InfluxDB, and TimescaleDB alike. This design also gives
predictable failure behavior: a crashed writer loses at most its in-memory
buffer, which is recovered by WAL replay, and a segment read during compaction
is served from the old copy until the new segment is committed.

### Q2. How do you ingest high-frequency writes efficiently?

The key is batching and sequential writes. Writers do not insert one row per
sample into a B-tree; they buffer samples in memory, group them by series, sort
by timestamp, and flush large blocks at once. This amortizes per-sample overhead
— each sample becomes a few bytes inside a block — and turns what would be
random inserts into sequential appends. The ingest API accepts batches over HTTP
or gRPC, and a write queue decouples the API from the disk flush so a slow
compaction never back-pressures ingestion. Backpressure only applies at the
buffer level, where a full queue tells the client to slow down rather than
dropping silently.

Because samples for a series arrive in near-time order, each writer keeps an
append-only buffer per active series and spills to disk only when the buffer
fills. Multiple writer nodes shard by series — consistent hashing over the
series ID spreads load evenly — and each shard writes its own segment files, so
write throughput scales with the number of writers. On failure, the queue
redelivers and the TSDB deduplicates identical (series, timestamp, value)
tuples, so retries are safe. Idempotent writes plus buffered, sharded,
sequential flushes are what let a single cluster absorb millions of points per
second while keeping disk I/O near its theoretical maximum. The queue itself is
partitioned and replicated so a writer outage does not lose buffered data, and
the ingest path reports per-series write throughput and queue depth as
first-class metrics so operators see saturation before latency collapses.

### Q3. How do you compress and downsample old data?

Raw time-series samples compress extremely well because adjacent timestamps and
values are correlated. Timestamps are stored as deltas, and deltas-of-deltas
(the Gorilla scheme from Facebook) shrinks most timestamps to one or two bytes.
Values are XOR-encoded against the previous value, so unchanged or slowly
changing series cost almost nothing per point. Combined with dictionary encoding
for repeated label values and LZ-style block compression, a typical 16-byte
sample can compress to about 2 bytes — a 5–8x reduction — which is why a TSDB
can hold months of data on modest disks.

Downsampling reduces the data that is no longer hot but still needs to be
queryable. A downsampler periodically compacts older segments into coarser
resolutions — 1-second raw points become 1-minute min/max/mean/sum, then 1-hour
— and stores the precomputed aggregates alongside the raw range. Queries that
fit the coarser bucket read far less data, and the raw points can be deleted or
moved to cold object storage after a retention window. Because compaction is a
merge of immutable segments, it is crash-safe: a partially compacted segment is
simply rebuilt from its inputs, and tombstones from deletes are only reclaimed
during compaction. Retention policy is the final lever, trading storage cost
against query precision across hot, warm, and cold tiers. Compression ratios are
verified continuously: the writer samples encoded block size against raw size,
and a ratio that degrades — for example after a label schema change — alerts
before storage costs balloon.

### Q4. How do you query ranges and aggregations fast?

Range queries lean on the time index plus the sorted, immutable segment layout.
The index maps series ID to its segment list and block offsets; a query resolves
the series and issues a seek into the first block at the requested start time,
then reads forward sequentially to the end time. Because blocks are sorted by
timestamp, the query skips everything outside its range — it never scans the
full series. The hot cache serves recent ranges from memory, and the query
engine prefers cached block summaries over full scans when a coarser answer
suffices. A label filter is resolved first through the series index, so a query
for "cpu and host=prod" touches only the matching series instead of everything.

Aggregations exploit precomputation. The downsample tier already holds
min/max/mean/sum per bucket, so a range aggregation over an older window sums
bucket summaries instead of iterating points. For raw-range aggregations, the
engine reads blocks and reduces incrementally, parallelizing across shards and
folding partial results in a merge step. The query API exposes downsampled views
by default and raw point views when explicitly requested, which keeps dashboard
queries fast even on multi-year ranges. Correctness is maintained by routing
queries through the same index and by carrying the aggregation metadata in the
segment headers, so the engine always knows which precomputed aggregates exist
and which resolution to use. Cardinality control is part of query performance:
the series index is kept healthy by enforcing bounded labels and per-series
write limits, because runaway series cardinality degrades both indexing and
range seeks regardless of the storage engine.

### Q5. How do you handle out-of-order and late data?

Real systems deliver samples late — a network partition, a rebuffered agent, or
a clock-skewed sensor — and a TSDB must ingest them without corrupting the
append-only timeline. The design separates in-order from out-of-order handling.
In-order samples append to the active buffer as usual. Late samples, whose
timestamp predates the current buffer's high-water mark, are routed to a
separate out-of-order buffer keyed by (series, timestamp); the writer merges
them into existing segments during the next compaction pass, when a sorted merge
reorders the timeline correctly. This keeps the main ingest path append-only
while the merge handles reordering cheaply and in bulk.

The out-of-order buffer is bounded: each series keeps a configurable window
(often minutes to hours), and samples older than that are rejected or dropped to
a dead-letter queue with an error surfaced to the writer. Deduplication handles
the duplicate case — a retried write with the identical (series, timestamp,
value) tuple is idempotent and silently ignored. Downsampling must also tolerate
late data: buckets are not finalized until a grace period passes, and a late
sample arriving after a bucket was compacted is folded into the next compaction
pass rather than lost. Finally, the TSDB exposes the effective watermark per
series — the latest timestamp for which all samples are present — so a range
query can tell users whether it has seen everything, preventing misleading gaps
in dashboards during an ingestion backlog. The watermark is indexed so a query
can cheaply report "data through 14:00" and flag any gap, and operators can
widen the out-of-order window for known-flaky sources while keeping the default
tight for the steady state.

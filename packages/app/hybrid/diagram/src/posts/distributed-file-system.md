## Answers

### Q1. Design a distributed file system

A distributed file system stores files across many commodity machines while
presenting a single namespace. The architecture splits metadata from data: a
NameNode manages the namespace — the directory tree, file names, permissions,
and for each file the map from logical ranges to physical chunks — while a fleet
of chunk servers holds the actual data. A file is broken into fixed-size chunks,
each chunk stored on several chunk servers for redundancy, and each chunk server
reports its health and inventory to the NameNode. The gateway handles uploads
and reads: the chunk splitter divides incoming files, and the location service
translates a read request into the list of chunk servers that hold the needed
ranges.

The two planes have completely different scale profiles. Metadata is small —
bytes per file — so the NameNode can hold the whole namespace in memory and
answer every lookup in microseconds; data is huge, so chunk servers are sized by
storage and bandwidth and are expected to fail constantly. This asymmetry is the
point of the design: the metadata plane stays fast and consistent while the data
plane scales out and self-heals. The file system also needs durable guarantees
around atomic renames, open semantics, and snapshot or append operations, and it
must tolerate concurrent readers and writers. The hard problems are chunk
location, replication, and recovery — the NameNode must always know where every
chunk lives and must always be able to rebuild a chunk that was lost.
Availability and durability guarantees are published per file class.

### Q2. How do you split files into chunks?

Files are split into fixed-size chunks, typically 64 MB or 128 MB, chosen to
balance overhead against parallelism. A large chunk means few metadata entries —
the NameNode tracks one mapping per chunk rather than per kilobyte — and it
amortizes the per-chunk bookkeeping, but it reduces parallelism for small files
and inflates the cost of a partial read. The splitter handles files of any size:
a small file becomes one chunk, while a multi-terabyte file becomes tens of
thousands. Each chunk gets a globally unique ID, and the NameNode records, per
file, the ordered list of chunk IDs plus each chunk's version. Because chunks
are immutable once written and replaced by new versions on rewrite, the mapping
stays simple and the read path never needs locks on data.

Splitting also needs to deal with appends and partial writes. An append is
handled as a new chunk or an extended chunk with a version bump, and the
NameNode's mapping is updated transactionally so a reader either sees the old
length or the new one, never a torn state. The chunk boundary interacts with
read efficiency: clients read chunk-aligned ranges so the location service can
return exactly the servers for the ranges requested, and the file system
supports a sequential read pattern where the client requests the next chunk
before finishing the current one, hiding network latency. Chunk size is also a
replication and recovery unit — the smaller the chunk, the faster a lost chunk
can be re-replicated from its peers, so the choice of size directly bounds the
recovery time budget.

### Q3. How do you replicate chunks for durability?

Every chunk is stored on multiple chunk servers, by default three, so the loss
of one or even two servers does not lose data. The replication policy is chosen
when the chunk is created: the system picks servers on different racks or
failure domains, keeps the load balanced across servers, and prefers to place
the replicas near clients that write or read the chunk most. When a client
writes a chunk, one server is chosen as the pipeline leader; it receives the
data and forwards it to the next replica in a chain, so the bandwidth cost of
replicating three copies is roughly one copy, not three, and the client receives
a single acknowledgment when all copies are durable.

The replication system is proactive, not reactive. The NameNode continuously
reconciles its view of the world: each chunk server reports its chunk inventory
on heartbeat, and the NameNode compares it against the desired state. A chunk
that is under-replicated — because a server died or a new replica was requested
— is added to a replication queue and rebuilt from an existing replica.
Re-replication is rate-limited so that recovering from a failed server does not
itself overload the cluster, and the system prioritizes chunks that are close to
losing their last replica. This makes durability a closed loop: a write is
durable when the pipeline finishes, and it stays durable because the NameNode
notices any drift from the target replication factor and fixes it continuously.

### Q4. How do you locate chunks quickly?

Chunk location is a pure metadata problem, and the design keeps it entirely off
the data path. The NameNode holds the complete mapping in memory: for each file,
the ordered chunk list; for each chunk, its replicas and their locations. A read
begins at the gateway, which asks the location service for the chunk list of the
requested byte range. The location service consults the NameNode, which answers
in microseconds with the ordered list of chunk IDs and, for each chunk, the
ranked list of chunk servers holding a replica. Ranking prefers a server in the
same rack or zone as the client and one with spare capacity, so the client can
fetch the nearest replica with minimal network crossing.

The trick is that the location answer must be correct even while the system is
changing. Chunk servers come and go, and replicas move, so the NameNode is the
single source of truth and every mutation — server join, server death, replica
creation, chunk deletion — updates the mapping transactionally. Clients cache
chunk-to-server mappings briefly and retry through the gateway on staleness,
which keeps the hot path fast without making the client part of the consistency
machinery. Because the metadata store is small relative to the data, the
NameNode can also replicate its state for availability and checkpoint it to a
durable metadata database, so a NameNode failure means the mapping is restored
quickly and the data plane continues to serve from the chunk servers.

### Q5. How do you recover from node failures?

Failure is the default state of a distributed file system, so recovery is
designed in rather than bolted on. Chunk servers send periodic heartbeats; when
the NameNode stops hearing from one, it marks the server lost and schedules its
chunks for re-replication. Chunk inventory on the heartbeats also catches silent
corruption — each chunk stores a checksum, and reads or background scanners that
find a mismatch trigger a rewrite from a healthy replica. The rebalancer and the
NameNode prioritize repairs: chunks that are missing one of three replicas are
re-replicated first, and the recovery rate is throttled so rebuilding a dead
server does not saturate the network or starve live traffic.

The NameNode itself must also survive. Its metadata is checkpointed and
journaled, and the system runs a standby NameNode that watches the primary's
log, so a primary failure fails over to a standby in seconds rather than
requiring a long metadata rebuild. If the metadata store is entirely lost, the
system can reconstruct the namespace from the chunk servers' self-reported
inventories, with the data plane intact — a last-resort recovery that restores
the system to a consistent, if slightly stale, state. Replica placement is what
bounds recovery: because chunks were spread across racks and servers, losing one
server at a time is survivable, and the system deliberately avoids scheduling
multiple replicas of a chunk on one machine or rack. The design goal is a system
where a node dies, its data is repaired automatically, and nothing that depends
on the file system notices anything beyond a few seconds of degraded
parallelism.

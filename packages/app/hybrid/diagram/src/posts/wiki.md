## Answers

### Q1. Design a wiki / knowledge base

A wiki is a shared document store organized into spaces, where anyone with
permission can create and edit pages and every change is recorded. The core
concepts are simple: a Page Service owns the content of pages, a Space Service
organizes pages into sections, a Revision Engine snapshots every edit, a
Permissions service guards access, and a Search Index makes the corpus
discoverable. Everything sits behind an API gateway that authenticates the
author and authorizes the request before it touches a page. This
authorization-first design is central, because the value of a wiki depends on
trust that internal pages stay internal.

The write path is where a wiki differs from a plain document store. When an
author saves a page, the Page Service validates the input, checks permissions,
writes the new content, and hands the previous version to the Revision Engine,
which snapshots it. Search indexing, cache invalidation, and watcher
notifications all subscribe to the change event rather than blocking the save.
Pages DB is a relational store partitioned by space, so most operations are
scoped to a single partition; page content is stored separately from metadata
because documents can be large and are fetched infrequently compared with page
titles and trees.

The read path serves two very different audiences. Browsing walks the page tree,
which favors a cached hierarchy; searching jumps straight to relevant documents,
which favors an inverted index. The Page Cache holds hot pages and tree
fragments so repeat views never hit the database. Notifications complete the
loop: watchers subscribe to pages or whole spaces, and any edit fans out an
email or in-app alert. The architecture keeps these concerns decoupled, so a
spike in search traffic never slows down saving an edit, and a heavy edit burst
never starves the search indexer.

### Q2. How do you model page revisions and history?

Revisions are the identity of a wiki page over time. Each page has a permanent
ID, and each save creates a new revision with a sequence number, the author, a
timestamp, and a change summary. The current content lives in a read-optimized
row, while the full history is an append-only revision log. Storing every full
copy would balloon storage, so mature designs use delta compression: the current
version is stored whole, older versions are reconstructed from deltas, and
periodic full snapshots bound reconstruction cost. A view history endpoint
returns the list, and a compare endpoint computes a three-way diff between any
two revisions.

The revision model must also capture intent. Confluence supports concurrent
editing, so a page can have a chain of revisions and a concurrent branch that
gets merged. Each revision records its parent revision IDs, which lets the
system build a DAG rather than a linear list when conflicts occur. Metadata such
as page title and labels is revisioned alongside content, because renaming a
page or retagging it is also a meaningful change. The revision engine therefore
snapshots the whole page state, not just the body text.

History queries need to be fast even on huge wikis. Comparing two revisions is
reduced to comparing their stored states or replaying a bounded delta chain, and
the per-page index on the revision log means listing history for a single page
is a point lookup. Cleanup is a deliberate policy: space administrators can
squash old revisions to reclaim space, with an audit record of the squash.
Versioning also powers restore, where the page is set to an old revision, which
itself becomes a new revision so the rollback is visible in history rather than
silently destroying later edits.

### Q3. How do you implement permissions across spaces?

Permissioning in a wiki is a hierarchy with space at the center. Every page
belongs to a space, so access is primarily determined by the space's ACL: who
can view, comment on, or edit the pages inside it. Individual pages and even
individual page versions can override the space defaults with restrictions, but
those are exceptions recorded as extra entries on the page record. The
Permissions service resolves any request by first finding the space ACL, then
overlaying page restrictions, and finally applying group membership, because
users are typically granted access through groups rather than individually.

Evaluation order and caching decide the cost. Resolving a single access check
must be fast, because a page render triggers several checks: view, edit, and
comment permissions are checked independently. The service caches resolved
permissions per user and per space, with the cache keyed by ACL version; any
change to a space's permissions bumps the version and invalidates the cached
grants. For the common case of a user reading pages inside their own space, the
check is a single cached lookup. Denials are also cached, with a shorter TTL, so
that an unauthorized user cannot hammer the database probing pages.

The subtle problems are inheritance and anonymous access. Public spaces are a
product feature, so the permission model must represent the special "anonymous"
and "logged-in" principals alongside real users and groups. Inheritance becomes
tricky with nested page trees: a restriction on a parent page must propagate to
its children, but an explicit grant on a child can override it. The resolution
algorithm walks from the most specific entry upward, and the cache stores the
outcome per page subtree. Every permission change is logged to an audit trail,
both for security and because wikis frequently become part of a compliance
regime where who could see what at a given date matters.

### Q4. How do you index pages for search?

Search turns a wiki from a document store into a knowledge base. Every page is
indexed with its title, body text, labels, author, space, and last modified
time, and queries combine free-text relevance with structured filters like space
and label. Indexing runs off the change-event stream: when a page is created or
edited, an event lands on a queue and the indexer updates that document. This
decouples the write path from indexing cost, and an indexing backlog is a health
signal rather than a user-facing failure.

Relevance needs wiki-specific weighting. Page titles and labels carry more
weight than body text, recently edited pages rank higher than stale ones, and
pages in spaces the user belongs to are preferred. The index stores document
fields and boosts them at query time, so a search for a term that appears in a
title can return the right page even when hundreds of pages mention it in the
body. Permissions shape the index as well: each document records the visibility
scope derived from its space, and the query filters documents by the requester's
access set, reusing the cached permission resolution from the ACL service.

Freshness and consistency are the practical concerns. A user who just saved a
page expects it to appear in search immediately, so the index is designed for
sub-second propagation while tolerating brief staleness during failures. Retries
with a cursor keep the indexer eventually consistent with the source of truth.
Periodically, a reconciliation job compares the index against the database to
repair documents that drifted. Large attachments are not indexed into the text
index; they are handled by a separate attachment pipeline that extracts text
only for supported file types, so the main index stays lean and fast.

### Q5. How do you handle concurrent edits?

Concurrent editing is the case that separates a wiki from a static document
host. Two authors can open the same page at once, both edit, and both save. The
system prevents lost updates with a version check: the save request carries the
revision it was based on, and if the stored revision is newer, the save is
rejected with a conflict. The server keeps the page content as the authoritative
version and gives the later editor a chance to merge. Simply overwriting would
silently destroy work, so conflict detection is the non-negotiable baseline.

Three policies handle conflicts. First, last-write-wins is acceptable only for
page metadata where both edits are equivalent, and even then it is applied with
an explicit revision bump. Second, an automated merge succeeds when the edits
touch disjoint sections; the system uses a diff against the common ancestor to
detect overlap. Third, when edits overlap, the platform presents a merge screen
showing the two versions side by side, lets the author choose, and records the
result as a new revision with both authors credited. The result is that
concurrent edits rarely block a user, and every resolution is visible in
history.

Soft conflicts add another layer. One author editing the body while another
edits the title should also produce a merge rather than a clobber, so the
revision engine snapshots title and body independently and merges per field.
This is the reason the page model separates content into distinct fields.
Autosave further complicates things: periodic draft snapshots can arrive out of
order, so each draft carries the base revision and is ignored if it is older
than what the server already has. Taken together, the design accepts that
conflicts are unavoidable and instead minimizes their blast radius, keeping the
single source of truth on the server at all times.

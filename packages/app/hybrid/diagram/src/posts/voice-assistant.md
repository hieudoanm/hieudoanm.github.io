## Answers

### Q1. Design a voice assistant

A voice assistant takes a spoken command and performs an action, and the entire
product is a latency chain: every stage from wake word to response adds to the
time before the device speaks back. The architecture is split between on-device
and cloud processing. On the device, the Wake Word Engine runs continuously and
cheaply, listening for the trigger phrase. When detected, the device streams
audio to the Assistant Gateway, which runs the Speech-to-Text service to produce
text, then the Intent Parser to extract the user's goal and slots such as the
song name or room. The Skill Router dispatches the intent to the appropriate
skill or action provider, the Action Service executes it, and the Text-to-Speech
service synthesizes a response that the device plays. A Response Cache and a
Session DB handle repeats and multi-turn conversation respectively.

The defining design constraint is the coupling between real-time audio and all
the services behind it. Speech cannot be retried the way an HTTP request can, so
the gateway treats each utterance as an event that flows through the pipeline
exactly once, with the session context attached so the assistant understands
references like "turn it off". The response must be spoken quickly enough to
feel natural, typically under a couple of seconds for the audio reply to start,
which forces each stage to be fast and the whole chain to be observable. The
system is designed as a vertical pipeline where every stage can fail
independently, and the failure handling decides whether the user perceives the
product as intelligent or broken.

The system also has to handle a fundamental ambiguity: what to do when the
assistant is not sure. Confidences are propagated from speech recognition
through intent parsing, and low confidence at any stage routes to a confirmation
question rather than a wrong action. The skill ecosystem is open, so the Skill
Router is a registry with authentication and rate limits rather than a fixed
list. Session state keeps conversations coherent, and privacy controls,
including on-device processing and audio deletion, shape where each stage runs.

### Q2. How do you handle wake word detection on device?

Wake word detection runs on the device because it has to listen for the trigger
phrase constantly, from power-on to power-off, and streaming all that audio to
the cloud would be both expensive and invasive. The Wake Word Engine is a small
neural network, a few megabytes, designed to run on a low-power DSP or the
device's main processor. It consumes a rolling window of audio frames, often
every 20 to 40 milliseconds, and scores each window for how likely it contains
the wake word. To be useful it must be nearly always correct: a false wake
triggers a cloud round trip and interrupts the user, so the threshold is tuned
to favor missed triggers slightly over false triggers, and a second-stage
verification on the device rejects obvious false positives before any audio
leaves the device.

The device-side design manages the resource tradeoffs. The continuous listener
must not drain the battery or block other audio, so it runs in a low-power mode
with aggressive audio preprocessing that reduces the sampling rate and
suppresses background noise before scoring. The wake word model is personalized:
the system adapts to the user's voice and accent over time, and a competing-word
model actively learns the phrases users commonly say that sound similar, so the
engine can reject lookalike utterances. Privacy shapes the design too, because
the wake word is the boundary after which audio is processed, so the engine's
design goal is making that boundary reliable.

The cloud is still involved in wake word quality, asynchronously. Device logs
report near-miss events, audio that scored just below the trigger threshold, and
false-wake samples with the user's reaction, and these are aggregated to retrain
the wake word model and tune the thresholds per device family. The result is a
feedback loop between the device and the cloud that improves wake word accuracy
without streaming continuous audio. Because the wake word is the first gate of
the whole assistant, its false wake rate and missed wake rate are among the most
carefully measured metrics in the product, and the models are versioned and
rolled out through device firmware updates.

### Q3. How do you convert speech to intent reliably?

Converting speech to intent is a two-stage pipeline: speech to text, then text
to meaning. The Speech-to-Text stage transcribes the utterance, and the Intent
Parser then maps the transcript to an intent, such as "play music" or "set an
alarm", with slot values, such as the artist or the time. Each stage carries
confidence, and the product decision is made on the combination. A transcript
with high acoustic confidence but low intent confidence, or the reverse, is
treated as uncertain. The system does not silently guess: it propagates the
joint confidence forward so the orchestrator can decide whether to act, ask a
clarifying question, or escalate.

Reliability comes from constraining the problem. The intent parser is trained on
the assistant's skill schema, so it knows the set of possible intents and slot
types, and it extracts entities using a combination of neural semantic parsing
and rule-based extraction for well-structured slots such as numbers, times, and
names. Slots are validated against the domain: an alarm time must be a real
time, a media query must resolve to a real artist. The design also uses context
heavily, because the same words mean different things mid-conversation: "play it
again" depends on what was played before, and "set it to five" depends on the
attribute being discussed. The Session DB provides that state to the parser on
every turn.

The system is evaluated on end-to-end accuracy, not stage accuracy. The metric
that matters is whether the right action happens, so transcripts and intents are
sampled and judged jointly, and the feedback feeds both the speech model and the
intent model. Ambiguity is handled by design rather than by chance: when two
intents score closely, the assistant asks a disambiguating question, which is
better than executing the wrong action. The pipeline also exposes a confidence
breakdown to skill developers so skills can make their own decisions about
low-confidence requests.

### Q4. How do you orchestrate skills and actions?

The Skill Router is the control plane that decides which skill handles an
intent. It holds a registry of skills, each declaring the intents it can handle,
the slots it expects, and the permissions it needs. When the Intent Parser
produces an intent, the router looks up candidate skills, resolves the best one
using both the intent confidence and the skill's declared compatibility, and
invokes it. Skills may be first-party, such as timers and music, or third-party,
so the router is also a marketplace boundary: it authenticates the skill
invocation, applies rate limits, and isolates third-party failures so a slow or
buggy skill cannot degrade the whole assistant.

Orchestration is where sessions come together. A single user turn can require
multiple actions, such as turning on lights in several rooms, so the
orchestrator expands the intent into an action list and executes each one,
collecting the results for the response. Some actions are asynchronous, such as
starting a robot vacuum, so the orchestrator distinguishes a completed action
with an immediate response from a pending action with a follow-up notification.
The Action Service is the boundary to the physical world, talking to device
clouds and home hubs, so every action carries idempotency keys to prevent
duplicate execution when a network retry happens.

Reliability in orchestration means failing safely. If a skill is slow, the
orchestrator either times it out and asks the user to retry or falls back to a
more capable general skill. If the action requires a permission the user has not
granted, the flow stops at a consent prompt rather than silently failing. Every
invocation is logged with the intent, skill, latency, and outcome, and the logs
power both quality monitoring and developer dashboards. The routing layer is
deliberately thin: it performs no domain logic, so new skills can be added and
promoted by configuration, and the whole system scales by adding more stateless
orchestrator replicas behind the gateway.

### Q5. How do you handle errors and fallbacks?

Error handling is what separates a usable assistant from a frustrating one,
because a voice interface gives the user no error dialog and no retry button.
The system defines a ladder of fallbacks based on confidence. When the pipeline
is confident, the assistant acts and speaks a short confirmation. When
confidence is moderate, it asks a clarifying question, echoing what it
understood so the user can correct it. When confidence is low, it plays a
universal fallback: "I'm not sure I understood" combined with a suggestion of
related capabilities. Each rung of the ladder trades speed for safety, and the
fallback text is written to sound helpful rather than broken, because the user's
perception of failure is shaped by how the failure is handled.

Skill failures are handled separately from understanding failures. A skill that
times out, throws an error, or returns an unexpected result triggers a retry
with a fresh attempt, then a fallback response that explains the problem and
offers an alternative. The Assistant Gateway tracks conversation state so a
fallback can ask the user to rephrase without losing the session context. Errors
are also ranked: a failure to connect to a device cloud gets a different
response than a failure to understand the request, and the system learns which
fallback messages recover the conversation best by measuring whether the user
continues speaking.

Observability is the foundation of all fallback design. Every turn is logged
with the confidence breakdown at each stage, the error type if any, and the
fallback that was triggered, and these logs are analyzed to find the most common
failure modes. Frequent patterns are fed back as training data for the intent
parser and as documentation for skill developers. The fallback itself can be
personalized: for a user who repeatedly tries one skill, the assistant surfaces
that skill's help content. The design principle is that a voice assistant should
never respond with silence, because silence is the only error the user cannot
forgive.

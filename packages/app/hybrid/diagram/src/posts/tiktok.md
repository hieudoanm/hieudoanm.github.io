## Answers

### Q1. Design a short-form video app

The app has two pillars: an upload/encoding pipeline and a highly personalized
read path. On upload, the client streams the video to an upload service, which
queues it for encoding workers; the workers produce multiple adaptive renditions
and split each into short segments, then publish to a video store fronted by a
CDN. The read path is the feed: the client requests the next page, the feed
service asks a ranker for a scored batch of candidate videos, and the videos
stream from the CDN while the app logs watch signals (view time, likes, shares,
skips) back to the system. A watch history store feeds the ranker, an effects
service layers AR/effects on uploads, and a notification service drives
engagement.

Latency is the defining constraint. Scrolling to the next video must be instant,
so candidate selection is precomputed and served from in-memory caches, and
video delivery is CDN-only — the app itself never proxies video bytes. The
upload path is de-coupled from the browse path: a creator's video is available
to friends immediately (single fast rendition), while the heavy multi-rendition
encoding happens asynchronously and upgrades quality over the next minutes. The
system is built for asymmetry — a few thousand creators upload while tens of
millions scroll — so the feed path is optimized for cheap reads over a large,
pre-scored catalog, and the platform handles a long-tail catalog where most
videos are watched by only a handful of users.

### Q2. How do you store and serve millions of short videos?

Videos are stored as segmented adaptive content: each upload is encoded into
renditions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p) and each rendition into ~2-second segments,
all addressed by a content ID and stored in a distributed object store
partitioned by video ID and time. Storing segments rather than one blob enables
adaptive bitrate playback (the player requests per-segment from the nearest
edge), cheap partial caching (an edge can cache the first segments that most
viewers watch), and progressive availability (the first segment is served before
later segments finish encoding). The video store keeps the full original for
re-encoding, plus per-rendition segments for serving. Serving goes through a
global CDN: the player requests segments from the nearest edge, edges pull on
miss from origin, and origin pre-seeds the first few segments of trending videos
to edges in the regions where they are trending.

The catalog metadata (video ID, creator, duration, captions, tags) lives
separately in a metadata DB and search index, so browse never touches video
bytes. Storage economics matter because short video is massive but mostly cold:
old and rarely-watched videos are moved to cheaper, colder tiers with longer
retrieval times, while only the hot set is kept warm; segment-level caching
means even cold videos serve acceptably because only the first segments are
fetched on first scroll. Deduplication and content hashing prevent re-uploads
and link re-used clips to the original. Monitoring tracks CDN hit rate,
per-segment fetch latency, and edge pull-back-to-origin rates — a low edge hit
rate on a viral video is the first sign to pre-seed more edges.

### Q3. How do you build the For You feed?

The For You feed is a two-stage ranking system: candidate generation then
scoring. Candidate generation gathers a few hundred videos from multiple sources
— following, topic clusters, related-to-recently-watched, and a global sample of
fresh/popular content — using a lightweight retrieval from the video catalog
(embedding similarity via an ANN index or tag-based filters) so the scorer sees
a tractable candidate set. The ranker then scores each candidate with a model
(gradient-boosted trees or a neural ranker) over features: the user's watch
history (viewed, liked, shared, skipped and for how long), video features
(creator, topic, engagement velocity, recency), and context (time of day,
network). Scores blend predicted engagement and diversity/exploration — a feed
that only shows lookalikes kills retention, so the ranker adds an exploration
term that varies over time and surface.

The feed is served from precomputed and cached state. Because per-request
ranking over millions of videos is infeasible, each user's candidate pool and a
ranked list are precomputed in batch (updated as watch history accumulates),
refreshed in the background, and stored in a per-user feed cache; the feed
service serves page N by slicing the cached list, and the client's skip signals
trigger an asynchronous re-rank. The hard part is freshness vs cost: a fresh
viral video must surface quickly, so the batch pipeline runs frequently
(minutes, not days) and injects trending items on top of the ranked base list.
Cold-start users get the global-trending blend until the model has watch data.
Analytics loops back continuously — every scroll is logged, the ranker is
retrained on engagement data, and the feed quality is tracked by metrics like
per-session watch time and skip-at-first-second rate.

### Q4. How do you make uploads fast and encoding cheap?

Upload speed comes from moving heavy work out of the request path. The client
streams the video directly to the upload service with resumable, chunked
transfer and parallel chunk upload; the service computes a content hash for
dedupe (re-uploaded or recycled clips skip re-encoding), then immediately
publishes a single fast rendition so the video is playable within seconds. Full
encoding runs asynchronously on a GPU/CPU worker pool: the original is decoded
once and re-encoded into multiple renditions for adaptive playback, with a
"priority-ordered" strategy — the most-watched rendition (e.g., 720p) is
produced first, then the rest — so quality improves progressively while the
video is already live. A queue holds the jobs, and workers scale with backlog.

Cost optimization drives the encoding strategy. Renditions are produced on
demand: a video with few views keeps only the fast rendition, and higher
renditions are lazily generated only when the video shows enough watch time to
justify the compute. Bitrate ladders are tuned per video — a static slideshow
clip doesn't need 1080p; a fast-action clip does — so the encoder picks the
ladder from an analysis pass. Hardware acceleration (GPUs, ASICs) amortizes the
dominant cost, and batch processing aligns with off-peak pricing when possible.
Correctness is preserved by idempotent encoding jobs: a worker crash restarts
from the source with the job marked not-done, and dedupe keys ensure the same
content isn't encoded twice. Monitoring tracks upload-to-playable latency,
encoding cost per video, and queue backlog — the leading indicators of the
upload experience.

### Q5. How do you handle viral spikes in traffic?

A viral spike is a super-linear burst of reads on a handful of videos plus a
surge of new uploads imitating the trend. The defense is layered. First,
delivery: the CDN absorbs the read spike — a trending video's segments are
pre-seeded to edges in the affected regions before the spike peaks (detected
from early engagement velocity), so the origin sees mostly first-pulls, and
segment-level caching means even a million concurrent viewers hit the same few
hundred cached segments. Second, the feed path: trending candidates are
pre-scored and cached, so the ranker is not re-run for each scroll; the feed
service serves from the per-user cache and sheds by returning cached pages under
load. Third, the upload path: dedupe and fast-rendition-only for the first
minutes mean a viral re-upload does not trigger the full encoding ladder
immediately.

Beyond capacity, viral handling is about isolation. The metadata DB and watch
history store are sharded per user, so a flood of events from one viral video
does not contend for other users' shards; the event ingestion pipeline
backpressures via the queue rather than dropping. Rate limiting at the API
gateway protects the catalog and notification services from retry storms when a
viral push is sent. The platform deliberately sizes for elasticity — the worker
pool and CDN burst scale on demand, and circuit breakers degrade non-critical
features (effects, recommendations) under extreme load rather than letting one
viral video take down scroll. Monitoring tracks per-video CDN edge hit rate,
origin pull rate, and feed cache miss rate; a spike that pushes origin pulls up
is the signal to pre-seed more edges before latency degrades.

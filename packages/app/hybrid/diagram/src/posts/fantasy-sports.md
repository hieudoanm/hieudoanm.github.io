## Answers

### Q1. Design a fantasy sports platform

A fantasy sports platform lets team owners draft real athletes, manage rosters,
and compete on the athletes' live game performance. The League Service owns
leagues, memberships, and season structure, and the Roster Service tracks each
team's players and lineups. The Draft Engine runs the live draft where owners
take turns selecting players. During the season, a Stats Provider supplies live
game data, the Live Scoring component computes fantasy points from that data,
and the Roster Service applies the points to each team. Waiver claims and trades
are processed by the Waiver and Trades service, and the Notification Service
pushes score changes and transaction alerts. All league and roster state is
durable in the Leagues DB.

The platform has two dramatically different phases. The draft is a synchronized,
real-time event with a small window, where every owner acts in turn and the
system must keep all participants on the same pick state. The season is an
ongoing read-and-notify workload, where the dominant traffic is owners
refreshing their scores while live games are being played. These phases impose
different consistency and latency requirements, so they are built as separate
services rather than one monolith, even though they share the league data model.

The hard consistency requirements are concentrated in the draft and in roster
transactions. Two owners must never be assigned the same player, a drafted
player must be locked out of every other league's availability, and a trade must
be atomic: both teams' rosters change together or not at all. Live scoring, by
contrast, is derived data that can tolerate eventual consistency, since a few
seconds of scoring lag is acceptable. The design keeps these guarantees
localized, making the draft and transaction engines strictly serialized while
the scoring and notification paths scale out.

### Q2. How do you run live drafts with many users?

A draft is a strictly ordered event, so the Draft Engine is a state machine that
owns whose turn it is and which players remain available. The league's draft
order is fixed at creation, and the engine advances the turn only when the
current owner picks or their clock expires. The engine is the single authority
on pick validity: it checks that the selected player is still undrafted, that
the pick is in order, and that any roster rules such as position limits are
satisfied. Because there is one writer per league, the draft is naturally
serializable, and the guarantee that no player is picked twice follows from that
serialization.

All owners must see the same draft board instantly. The engine broadcasts every
pick, timer reset, and turn change to all league members over a real-time
channel, and each client renders the same authoritative state. When a pick
lands, the engine publishes it, and every other league immediately marks that
player unavailable. If an owner disconnects, the engine keeps running the clock;
if the clock expires, the engine auto-picks the best available player according
to a preset ranking, so a single absent owner does not stall the entire league.

The system must support drafts of very different sizes, from small casual
leagues to massive public leagues with hundreds of participants. The engine
scales by running one independent state machine per league, so thousands of
concurrent drafts are just thousands of independent, small state machines. The
shared hot spot is the player availability check, which is served from a
replicated in-memory index and updated through the pick events. A crash is
recovered by replaying the pick log, so the draft can resume from the last
committed pick rather than restarting.

### Q3. How do you score rosters against live games?

Scoring is a pure transformation from athlete performance to fantasy points. The
Live Scoring component ingests the stats feed from the Stats Provider, which
streams events such as a touchdown, a catch, or a passing yard, and maps each
event to the fantasy scoring rules configured for the league. The mapping is
deterministic and versioned, so the same event always produces the same points.
Because scoring rules differ by league, the mapper resolves the league's scoring
settings for each event rather than applying a single global formula, and the
resulting points are credited to the roster that owns the athlete.

The flow is a fan-out from one athlete to many teams. A single event in one real
game may affect thousands of rosters, so the scoring service cannot recompute
each team's total per event. Instead, it computes the points for the athlete
once, then applies the delta to every team with that athlete in their lineup,
and updates the team totals incrementally. Team scores are maintained as running
totals that move up as events land, which is exactly what owners expect from a
live score ticker. Late stat corrections, where the official scorer revises an
event, are handled by replaying the corrected event and applying a delta rather
than recomputing the season.

Consistency matters only at the margins. The score the owner sees may lag the
actual event by a moment, but it must never jump backward except for a
legitimate stat correction, and the final score must match the official result.
The system achieves this by keeping the stats feed as the ordering authority,
applying events in the provider's order, and writing the final game totals as
the authoritative result when the game ends. The live view is derived from the
event stream, while the final standings read the settled totals, so the two
never disagree once a game is official.

### Q4. How do you power the waiver wire and trades?

Roster changes are governed by rules that make the system more than a simple
mutation. The waiver wire is a claim process: after each period of real games,
owners submit claims for free agents, and the claims are processed in an order
determined by league settings, typically worst team first. The Waiver and Trades
service collects all claims, orders them, and awards each claimed player to
exactly one owner, atomically dropping the player the claiming owner releases.
Claim processing is a batch operation, not a live one, so it can be serialized
per league and executed when the waiver window closes.

Trades are bilateral but still need atomicity and validation. A trade proposal
swaps players and possibly draft picks between two rosters, and the exchange
must be validated against position limits, salary or cap rules, and the league's
trade review policy, such as a league vote or a commissioner veto. The critical
guarantee is atomicity: either both rosters change or neither does, and no other
transaction can interleave, because the two teams may otherwise briefly share
the same player. The service therefore applies the whole exchange as a single
database transaction with per-team locking.

Waivers and trades also have to stay consistent with the rest of the system. A
player who was just drafted or claimed must not be immediately re-traded in a
way that violates league rules, and a player on a team that is playing a live
game may be locked by the roster rules. Every transaction is timestamped and
recorded in the Leagues DB, so the transaction history is auditable and can be
reversed by a commissioner. The service is the only writer to roster state, so
live scoring and transaction processing never race over the same team.

### Q5. How do you push real-time score updates?

The notification problem is one-to-many with strict latency: one scoring event
must reach every interested owner within seconds. The system uses a
publish-subscribe path per league, where the Live Scoring service publishes
score deltas and the real-time delivery layer fans them out to the connected
clients of that league. The fan-out is scoped, so an event in a game affects
only the leagues that roster the involved athletes. Each owner receives a delta
and the updated team total, and the client updates the display without
refetching.

The push layer has to coexist with the fetch path. Owners are often on a web
page or app that is not actively connected, so the system runs both a push
channel for live connections and a query path backed by the aggregated scores
for late or reconnecting viewers. When a client connects, it receives a full
snapshot and then subscribes to deltas, so a reconnect is cheap and never misses
a score. The push channel carries only the changed numbers, keeping bandwidth
low even when thousands of owners watch the same Sunday slate of games.

Reliability and pacing shape the final design. A missed push must not lose a
score, so the client reconciles against the aggregated store on reconnect, and
the notification path retries in-flight deliveries. Alert cadence is controlled,
so owners are not spammed by every small event: threshold-based alerts, such as
a touchdown or a player reaching a point milestone, are sent as push
notifications, while the ticker handles the continuous deltas. The notification
service is decoupled from the scoring pipeline through a queue, so a slow
delivery tier never backs up the scoring path that every league depends on.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a content delivery network

A CDN moves content closer to users by caching it on edge servers distributed
across the world, so the vast majority of requests never reach the origin. The
user resolves the domain through a DNS router, which returns the IP of the
nearest healthy edge — nearest by measured network distance and load. The user
then requests content from that edge, which serves it from the edge cache on a
hit, or fetches it from the origin on a miss, caches it, and streams it back.
Large objects such as video are served as byte ranges and streamed, so a CDN is
functionally a reverse-proxy cache with a large, multi-tier storage layout.

Behind the data plane sits a control plane that owns cache policy (TTLs, cache
keys, vary rules), runs invalidation to purge stale content across all edges,
and tracks origin health. Access logs stream from every edge to an analytics
pipeline that produces per-URL, per-PoP, and per-customer metrics. Replication
is inherent — every point of presence independently caches — so the design must
balance hit ratio against cost: more copies raise hit ratio but consume capacity
and make purges slower. The classic tension is between serving from the closest
edge and serving from the edge most likely to already hold the content; routing
heuristics trade off these goals, and cache fill strategies (proactive push for
scheduled events, lazy fill otherwise) bias the trade in favor of the workload.
Capacity planning is per-PoP: each pop's disk, bandwidth, and origin-fetch
budget are monitored, and over-provisioned pops are preferred for new content
fills while constrained pops shed cold content to make room.

### Q2. How do you route users to the nearest edge?

Routing starts at DNS. The CDN's authoritative DNS servers see the resolver's IP
— or, with EDNS Client Subnet, the actual user's subnet — and return the IPs of
the closest point of presence (PoP). "Closest" is computed from a map of network
distances built from RTT measurements and IP-to-PoP tables, not from pure
geography, because undersea cable paths routinely beat straight-line distance.
The DNS response returns several edge IPs with a short TTL so routing can adapt
to failures and load shifts, and the DNS layer can shed a PoP by simply removing
it from responses.

Many CDNs reinforce DNS routing with anycast: every PoP advertises the same
addresses, and the network itself delivers each packet to the nearest PoP.
Anycast gives failover for free — a dead PoP stops advertising and traffic
reroutes — but it can steer a user's connections to different PoPs, so HTTP
keep-alives are pinned per connection to avoid cross-PoP hops. Larger CDNs
prefer unicast with a global load balancer that tracks per-PoP load and health,
gaining explicit control to divert traffic off a congested or degraded PoP.
Either way, the control plane periodically re-measures RTTs to tune the distance
map, and a user who lands on an uncached or overloaded PoP can be redirected at
the request layer to a better edge. Routing also accounts for content type:
video and large downloads may be directed to pops with spare bandwidth even if a
slightly closer pop is congested, while HTML and API traffic favor the
lowest-latency path.

### Q3. How do you keep edge caches consistent with origin?

Cache consistency is governed by cache-control headers from the origin plus
explicit invalidation. The origin sets TTLs per object — static assets get long
TTLs (hours to a year), HTML and API responses get short ones — and edges honor
`max-age`, `s-maxage`, `stale-while-revalidate`, and `ETag`/`Last-Modified`
headers. On a miss or an expired entry, the edge revalidates with the origin
using a conditional request (`If-None-Match`); a 304 returns the cached copy, a
200 refreshes it. Most content is deliberately served slightly stale, because
true freshness would require an origin round trip for every single read, which
would defeat the entire purpose of the CDN.

For changes that must propagate immediately — a corrected image, a revoked
resource — the control plane runs an invalidation. Invalidation is asynchronous
by design: the origin submits a purge job, the control plane spreads it to every
PoP, and each edge marks the affected cache entries stale and fetches fresh on
the next request. Because propagating to thousands of edges takes seconds to
minutes, purges are reconciled with versioned cache keys or manifests: content
URLs embed a version or hash (`v=123`), so the origin simply serves the new URL
and lets the old object expire naturally. Content versioning is the highest
throughput invalidation mechanism of all — it turns a global purge into a
cache-key cleanup job and makes the "consistent with origin" question mostly a
matter of correct TTL configuration. Cache-key design is part of consistency:
keys incorporate host, path, query, and the configured vary headers
(`Vary: Accept-Encoding`, `Vary: Cookie`), so responses that differ between
users never share an entry — and cookies are stripped from keys unless
explicitly allowed.

### Q4. How do you handle cache stampedes and thundering herds?

A stampede happens when a cache entry expires and a burst of requests arrives
simultaneously: without protection, one miss turns into thousands of
simultaneous origin fetches. The first defense is stale-while-revalidate: the
edge serves the stale copy immediately while exactly one request refreshes the
cache in the background, so users never wait and the origin receives a single
refresh instead of a herd. Request coalescing extends this — concurrent misses
for the same cache key wait on a single in-flight fetch rather than each
fetching from the origin independently, so the origin sees one request no matter
how many users arrive at once.

The second defense spreads expiry in time. If a popular object has a fixed TTL,
all copies at all PoPs expire at once; staggering TTLs per PoP or per edge node
smooths revalidation load over time so the origin is never hit by a synchronized
wave. A health-based backstop protects the origin further: when the control
plane sees origin load spike or origin health degrade, it instructs edges to
serve stale content for a grace period and to shield — funneling all origin
fetches for an object through a single shield tier per region, which absorbs the
herd and caches the result. These layers together let the system survive the
release of a viral video or a breaking-news event without collapsing the origin
under revalidation traffic. The same controls protect against hot-object
amplification: a single object's fill rate is capped per PoP, and origin health
checks propagate a degraded state to every edge so the whole network backs off
as one instead of each pop hammering the origin independently.

### Q5. How do you purge content across the network?

A purge begins at the control plane, which takes a request for a URL, URL
prefix, or cache tag and turns it into an invalidation event. The event is
broadcast to every PoP over the CDN's control channel, and each edge applies it
to its local cache index — marking matching entries stale, removing them, or
instantly replacing them with a freshly fetched version, depending on the purge
type. Because the fleet is enormous, the control plane batches events, assigns
each purge a sequence number, and tracks per-PoP acknowledgement so an operator
sees purge completion, not just submission. Purge propagation time is a product
spec: some guarantees are minutes, some seconds, and the system advertises them
honestly.

Correctness requires ordering: a purge must not race with a fetch that
re-populates the stale entry. Edges handle this by checking the purge generation
— every cache entry records the purge version it was created under, and a newer
purge invalidates older entries even if they were refreshed first. The purge
model also defines its own consistency boundary: purges are eventually
consistent across PoPs, so a client hitting one PoP may briefly see content that
another PoP already purged. For hard guarantees, content is versioned at the URL
level, which converts "purge everywhere" into "serve the new URL," and purging
becomes a housekeeping job rather than a correctness-critical path. Access logs
record purge activity alongside delivery, so analytics can correlate a purge
storm with a hit-ratio dip.

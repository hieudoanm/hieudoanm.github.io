- How do you model roles and permissions?
- How do you evaluate policies efficiently?
- How do you support SSO and federation?
- How do you keep an audit trail?

## Answers

### Q1. Design an identity and access management system

An IAM system answers two questions for every request: who is the caller, and
what is the caller allowed to do. Authentication verifies identity, usually
against an internal store or a federated identity provider, and produces a
token. Authorization then evaluates the caller against policies before the
application acts. Because IAM sits in front of every request, the design must
prioritize low latency, high availability, and a rigorous audit trail, while
keeping the authorization model expressive enough to express fine-grained rules
without exploding into unmanageable complexity.

The reference flow in the diagram starts when the user accesses an application
through the API gateway. The gateway sends the request to authentication, which
verifies the credential and may federate to an external identity provider. Once
the principal is established, the gateway invokes the authorization service,
which evaluates applicable policies, resolving roles through the role service
and fetching data from the policies database. The decision is cached, and every
check is recorded by the audit service before the allow or deny result is
returned to the application.

Two architectural choices shape the whole system. First, authorization must be
decoupled from application code so that policy changes do not require redeploys,
and so that a single place enforces rules consistently. Second, the system must
degrade safely: when the policy database or identity provider is unavailable,
the gateway needs a defined behavior, typically failing closed for sensitive
operations while relying on cached decisions and short token lifetimes to keep
legitimate traffic flowing.

### Q2. How do you model roles and permissions?

Permissions are atomic rights such as "read repo" or "delete user". Roles are
named collections of permissions that humans reason about, like "developer" or
"admin", and users get access by being assigned roles, either directly or
through groups. This role-based access control model keeps assignment simple,
but it needs hierarchy and scoping to scale: roles can inherit from other roles,
and grants are scoped to a resource or tenancy so that an "admin" role only
applies within a specific project or organization.

Groups add another layer between users and roles. Users join groups, groups map
to roles, and roles map to permissions, so membership changes propagate without
touching individual grants. The mapping tables are the core of the data model:
user-group, group-role, and role-permission associations, plus role assignment
directly to users for exceptions. Everything is versioned so that policy history
can be reconstructed for audit and rollback purposes. Versioned snapshots of a
role or policy also let the system answer historical questions, such as what a
user was allowed to do on a specific date, without reconstructing state from
change logs.

Policies generalize roles by expressing rules in terms of conditions rather than
just static permissions, such as "allow read only during business hours" or
"allow delete if the caller holds a second approval". The role service resolves
the effective permission set by walking inheritance and applying conditions. The
tension is expressiveness versus simplicity: pure roles are easy to reason about
but inflexible, while full policy languages can become undebuggable at scale, so
a good design offers a small, predictable policy language with roles as the
primary abstraction.

### Q3. How do you evaluate policies efficiently?

Policy evaluation runs on the hot path of every request, so it must be fast and
cheap. The classic approach is to precompute effective permissions when
assignments change and store the flattened result, so a request check becomes a
simple set membership lookup rather than a graph traversal. When policies
include dynamic conditions, the service evaluates those conditions against
request attributes, but it short-circuits on the first decisive rule and denies
by default, which keeps the common case to a single cache hit.

Caching is the dominant lever. A decision cache keyed by principal, action, and
resource stores the last result with a short TTL, and invalidation signals bump
the affected keys whenever roles or policies change. Because authorization data
changes slowly relative to request volume, a warm cache absorbs nearly all
traffic, with the policies database only touched on misses. Multi-region
deployments replicate the cache to avoid cross-region round trips for every
check.

Scale forces partitioning and limits. The policy engine must cap recursion depth
and rule count per evaluation so a malformed policy cannot consume unbounded
CPU, and evaluation is performed in an isolated execution context that can be
terminated if it exceeds its budget. Denials should be cached too, but with
shorter TTLs so a corrected policy propagates quickly. Finally, every decision
is returned with the version of the policy set that produced it, letting
operators correlate behavior changes with policy deploys. The service should
also expose the decision reason and the rules consulted, so an engineer who is
unexpectedly denied can inspect the evaluation trace instead of guessing at
policy semantics.

### Q4. How do you support SSO and federation?

Federation delegates authentication to an external identity provider such as
Okta, Azure AD, or a SAML/OIDC IdP. The IAM service plays the role of service
provider or relying party: it redirects the user to the IdP, receives a signed
assertion back, validates the signature, and maps the provider's claims to an
internal principal. The protocol choice matters, with OIDC typically preferred
for its JSON-based flow and SAML still common in legacy enterprise environments,
so the design should support both behind a common adapter.

The identity mapping layer handles the hard part of federation. Provider subject
identifiers must be translated into internal users, either by an explicit
account-linking table or by an email-based automatic provisioning policy. Issuer
trust is a security-critical configuration: only allowlisted issuers, validated
certificates, and audience restrictions can be accepted. Federation also brings
clock and replay concerns, so assertions carry expiries and nonces, and the
service rejects replays of previously consumed assertions.

Federated sessions still produce the IAM system's own tokens. After the IdP
assertion is verified, the IAM service issues its internal session and applies
the same authorization pipeline, which keeps downstream policy enforcement
consistent regardless of login method. The tradeoff is availability and latency:
when the IdP is down, users who already hold valid sessions can continue, but
fresh logins fail, so the design needs clear timeouts, fallback to local
authentication for selected flows, and monitoring of IdP health. Monitoring
should track federation failures by identity provider and protocol, so an outage
at one IdP is detected and routed around before it surfaces as a broad login
outage.

### Q5. How do you keep an audit trail?

Every decision, authentication event, and policy change is written to the audit
service, which appends to an append-only store. Each record carries the
principal, the action attempted, the resource, the decision, the client context
such as IP and user agent, and a timestamp. The data is retained in a structure
that supports forensic queries, so a security team can answer questions like
"who changed this permission and when" within seconds, even over long retention
windows.

The audit trail must be tamper-evident. An append-only log is a good start, but
a determined attacker with database access could edit it, so production systems
chain record hashes together and periodically ship signed checkpoint snapshots
to an immutable store. Storage costs grow quickly, so hot data lives in a
queryable system while cold data is compressed and archived, with a defined
retention policy that balances compliance requirements against cost. Retention
also has to respect data residency, since audit records may be required to stay
in the region where the account lives, which can rule out a single global store.

Audit and authorization must be coupled, not bolted on. The same request that
produces an authorization decision emits the audit record, so there is no gap
where a decision occurs without a trace. Policy changes are themselves audited
with the old and new versions, tying each change to its actor. Finally, the
audit stream feeds detection: aggregated logins from new devices, bursts of
denied requests, or policy changes outside a change window are signals that
should trigger automated alerts rather than waiting for a manual investigation.

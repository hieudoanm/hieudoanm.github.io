## Answers

### Q1. Design a notification service

The service is an async, event-driven pipeline between producers (other
microservices) and delivery providers. Producers push an event into an Event
Ingestion queue; a Fanout Worker then resolves the audience, filters it through
the Preference Service, dedupes, and dispatches one notification per
user-and-channel to the appropriate provider — Push Provider, Email Service, or
SMS Gateway. Every send attempt is logged to a Notification DB that also serves
the user's in-app inbox, so the inbox is just a read over the same records the
delivery path writes. Clients subscribe or change preferences through the API
gateway, which updates the Preference Service.

The core abstraction is a notification:
`{id, user_id, type, title, body, payload, channels, status}`. Events are
upstream facts ("you were tagged", "order shipped"), and the worker turns each
event into one or more channel-targeted notifications. Because delivery is
inherently unreliable (APNs and SMS gateways fail, are rate-limited, and
sometimes silently drop), the service is built around at-least-once semantics:
retries with exponential backoff, a dead-letter queue for poison messages, and
dedupe at the worker so retries don't produce duplicates. Delivery is decoupled
from creation — the sender never blocks on a push round-trip — and the inbox
guarantees the user eventually sees everything even if every push channel is
down.

### Q2. How do you fan out notifications to millions of users?

Fanout is the scalability bottleneck: one event ("flash sale live") can target
tens of millions of users. Partition the problem. First, resolve the audience as
a query or a stream rather than a list — a User Graph or segment index can yield
IDs in pages instead of materializing one giant list. Then chunk the audience
into batches and let the Fanout Worker shard them across a pool of worker
instances, each consuming a slice from the queue. Parallelism comes from the
chunking, not from any single process: a million-user fanout is ~10k batches of
100, spread across as many workers as the queue has partitions. Kafka
partitioned by user_id (or a hash of it) keeps one user's notifications ordered
and gives each partition its own consumer.

Backpressure and politeness matter as much as throughput. Push providers and SMS
gateways rate-limit aggressively and have per-app ceilings, so the worker must
shape the dispatch rate — a token bucket per provider tokenizes sends, and
providers get queued, paced deliveries instead of a burst. Chunking also enables
staggering: deliver in waves (first 1%, observe error rates, then the rest) so a
misconfigured template or dead provider doesn't burn the whole audience. If a
worker dies mid-fanout, the queue redelivers its chunk (at-least-once), and the
dedupe key per (user, event, channel) makes the replay idempotent. Monotonic
progress is tracked with a fanout record: a single `fanout_id` row counting
delivered/total, updated asynchronously by workers, so a human or scheduler can
pause, resume, or abort an in-flight broadcast.

### Q3. How do you choose delivery channels (push, email, SMS)?

Channel selection is a preference-driven decision, not a fixed rule. The
Preference Service stores per-user rules — which channels a user has enabled,
which event types they care about, quiet hours, and channel-specific addresses
(device tokens, email, phone) — and the Fanout Worker resolves each event
against those rules to produce the channel set. The decision also considers
event semantics and urgency: time-sensitive or transactional events (password
reset, security alert) tend to demand SMS or push regardless of marketing
preferences, while a breaking-news blast might use push with an email digest as
a fallback for users whose app is silent. A tiering model is common:
high-urgency events go out on every enabled channel, normal events default to
push + inbox, and low-priority events collapse into a daily digest email.

Practicalities shape the choice too. Cost is a first-class input — SMS is an
order of magnitude more expensive than push or email — so SMS is reserved for
true urgency and protected by per-user daily caps. Deliverability differs: push
is immediate but volatile (tokens expire, devices go offline), email is reliable
and cheap but slow and easy to ignore, SMS is immediate and hard to ignore but
expensive and spammy. Add fallback chains: if the preferred channel fails or the
user is offline after N attempts, promote to a secondary channel, and route
through whatever integration (vendor) the user's region supports. Finally, keep
channel state per user and update it on delivery failures — a dead device token
should be pruned so the next fanout doesn't burn time on it.

### Q4. How do you guarantee delivery with retries and dedupe?

Delivery guarantees stop at at-least-once; exactly-once is impossible when
downstream providers are unreliable, so the design makes duplicates cheap and
loss hard. Each notification carries a stable dedupe key — usually
`(user_id, event_id, channel)` — written to a Dedupe Cache (Redis) with a TTL
before the first send. Every worker retry checks and, critically, claims the key
atomically (a Lua `SET NX` or an INCR-with-expiry pattern) so two retries of the
same notification can't both dispatch. The send itself is tracked in the
Notification DB with states `pending → sent → delivered / failed`, and the
provider's async delivery receipt (APNs callback, SES notification, SMS DLR)
advances the state; a receipt that never arrives triggers a retry scheduler.

Retries are systematic: exponential backoff with jitter (e.g., 1s, 4s, 16s up to
a cap of a few hours), a max attempt count, and then a move to a dead-letter
queue for inspection rather than infinite retry. Idempotency extends through the
providers where possible — APNs uses a notification UUID so a duplicate send is
a no-op — but where it doesn't, dedupe on our side plus provider rate limits
keeps the duplicate rate negligible. For the inbox path, dedupe is natural: the
record is keyed by the dedupe key with a unique constraint, so inbox writes
can't double. On the failure side, treat provider outages as retryable, track
provider-level health to pause dispatch to a sick provider, and make the queue
durable so a crash at any stage resumes from the last ack, not from the start.

### Q5. How do you respect user notification preferences?

Preferences are the gate every notification must pass, so they live in a fast,
always-available service — a Redis-backed Preference Service with the source of
truth in a durable store — and the Fanout Worker resolves them for every
recipient before dispatching. The model is three-dimensional: what topics the
user subscribed to (type or category: mentions, promotions, product updates),
which channels are enabled per topic (push, email, SMS, inbox), and global
settings such as quiet hours and a master mute. A negative default — opt-in for
marketing, opt-out for transactional core like security or delivery — prevents
the service from ever being a spam vector. Quiet hours are enforced at dispatch:
notifications targeting a sleeping user are deferred to the next allowed window
or converted to an inbox-only copy.

Checking preferences for millions of recipients per fanout can't be a per-user
RPC, so the worker batches preference lookups (pipeline a Redis `MGET` or
`MULTI` for thousands of users per request) and caches per-user preference blobs
locally with a short TTL. Enforcement points: the worker filters the channel set
per user; a policy layer also applies global rules (anti-abuse caps, per-user
daily notification limits, spam classification) that override even enabled
preferences. On the write side, preference updates must be eventually consistent
and never silent — a user unsubscribing from a campaign must see the change
reflected in the next fanout, so preference changes are propagated to caches and
the fanout pipeline checks a version stamp. Finally, audit and self-serve: log
the preference decision with each notification so "why did I get this?" is
answerable, and provide unsubscribe links that update preferences through the
same API the fanout reads.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a code search engine

A code search engine lets developers find symbols, identifiers, and strings
across a huge corpus of repositories. The core is an offline pipeline: new
repository content is pushed to an index queue, consumed by an indexer, and
turned into an inverted index that a query engine reads to answer searches. The
query path parses the user's input, looks up matches in the index, applies
filters such as language or repository, and ranks the results before returning
them to the search UI.

The hardest part of code search is scale. The corpus is enormous and grows
continuously, so indexing must be incremental and distributed. Shards are
partitioned by repository or by a hash of the file path, and each shard keeps
its own inverted index plus a document store that maps file identifiers back to
repository, path, and line information. A search fans out to all shards in
parallel and merges the ranked results, with a small per-shard timeout so a
single slow shard cannot stall the whole query.

Precision matters as much as recall. Unlike web search, where ranking dominates,
developers querying code need exact identifiers and are annoyed by fuzzy misses.
The engine supports token-level queries, substring matching, symbol matches, and
operators like `lang:` and `repo:` so a search can be narrowed
deterministically. The result cache absorbs popular, repeated queries, and the
ranking service keeps the best matches on top. Instrumentation is part of the
design: every query records its parse time, shard fan-out, and result count, so
engineers can tell whether a slow search is a query-shape problem or a capacity
problem.

### Q2. How do you index large codebases?

Indexing starts when a repository is created or updated. The repository store
emits a change event onto an index queue, and indexer workers pull batches and
process them independently from search traffic, so index lag never degrades
query availability. Each file is tokenized according to its language, using a
lexer that produces both exact identifiers and structural tokens like class and
function names, which lets the index support symbol-aware queries later.

The inverted index maps tokens to document lists. Each posting stores the
document ID, the token position, and whether the token is an exact identifier or
appears in a comment, which later powers ranking and filters. To keep the index
compact, the engine applies normalization, stopword treatment tuned to code
rather than prose, and delta-encoded posting lists. Because a popular package
name can appear in millions of files, the engine uses skip lists and compressed
bitmaps so large postings stay queryable without loading everything into memory.

Indexing is also about evolution, not just initial load. When a file is deleted
or edited, the indexer must remove stale postings and add new ones, ideally as a
document-level replace rather than a full reindex. Shards are rebalanced as
repositories grow, and a separate verification pass reconciles the index against
the repository store to catch missed events. Backfills and reindexing are run as
scheduled jobs with progress tracking, because a silent index gap is worse than
a temporary lag. The indexer is versioned together with the tokenizer, so a
change in how identifiers are split produces a new index generation that can be
rolled out and rolled back independently of the search service.

### Q3. How do you search code with high precision?

Precision comes from how the query is parsed and matched. The query engine
breaks input into tokens and supports explicit operators, so
`isFunction keyword: delete` or `repo: kernel "OOM killer"` compile into a small
set of structured constraints rather than a single free-text bag. Exact
identifier matches, quoted substring matches, and case-sensitive matches are
handled with different index lookups, because mixing them is a common source of
wrong results.

Filtering shrinks the candidate set before expensive work happens. Language,
repository, path, branch, and author filters are pushed down into the index as
required terms, and when a filter is very selective it is evaluated first to cut
the fan-out. Symbol and structural metadata let the engine favor true
identifiers over matching words in comments or strings, which dramatically
improves the quality of results for short, common names.

The engine should also be honest about what it cannot do. Because code is highly
specific, the engine avoids aggressive query rewriting and synonym expansion,
which only add noise. Ranking then takes over: matches on exact identifiers, in
code rather than comments, and at a more central position in the file are
boosted. For expensive or rare features, the search UI offers a degraded mode
that still returns correct matches, keeping the system usable when the full
structural index is unavailable. For substring-style operators, the engine falls
back to a trigram index that bounds the candidate set, keeping exact queries
fast without making the common case pay the cost.

### Q4. How do you keep the index up to date?

Freshness is driven by events from the repository store. Every push, branch
update, or file rename produces a change record that lands on the index queue,
and indexer workers process the affected files and update the relevant shards.
The queue gives the pipeline a buffer: bursts of pushes are absorbed and workers
scale with backlog, while search continues serving the previous snapshot of the
index. The design targets near-real-time freshness, on the order of seconds to a
minute, without a global reindex on every push.

Consistency across shards needs care. A repository can touch several shards, and
an update is only visible once every affected shard has applied its portion.
Each shard maintains a monotonically increasing index generation, and the search
coordinator stamps queries with a minimum generation so results never mix a
partially applied update. In-flight queries hold a consistent snapshot, which
matters more than absolute freshness during large merges. Large batch events,
such as an organization importing thousands of repositories, are processed as a
scheduled backfill with rate control so they do not crowd out live updates on
the same shards.

Operational hygiene completes the loop. The indexer tracks lag per repository
and alerts when a shard falls behind, and a reconciliation job periodically
compares repository contents against the index to repair gaps. When indexing
logic changes, a targeted reindex of affected languages or repositories runs
behind the scenes. Finally, the index is deployed as an immutable artifact per
generation, so a bad indexing rule can be rolled back by serving the previous
generation instead of patching live data.

### Q5. How do you rank search results?

Ranking for code starts with match quality. Exact identifier matches score above
substring matches, matches in code score above matches in comments and strings,
and symbol definitions score above usages. The engine also considers how
recently the repository was updated, since developers usually want to fix code
in a living project rather than an archived one, and the popularity of the
repository, as a weak prior for relevance.

A small set of hand-tuned features keeps the ranking explainable. Frequency of
the term within the file matters but is dampened, because a token that appears
everywhere in a generated file is not more relevant. Token position in the file,
the specificity of the matched symbol, and the scarcity of the term across the
corpus all feed a score that blends precision with reasonable recall. The
ranking must stay cheap because it runs on every query against merged per-shard
results.

Ranking is only as good as the metrics. The system logs which results are
clicked, which queries have poor results, and which result sets are degenerate,
such as an exact identifier returning thousands of matches. Feedback feeds the
tuning loop for both ranking weights and indexing features. There is also a
qualitative dimension: developers complain loudly about ranking that buries the
obvious answer, so the design favors conservative, predictable ranking over
cleverness, and provides filter operators that let users override ranking
entirely when needed. Because ranking quality is subjective, the engine keeps
result ordering stable within a session and only surfaces new ranking logic
behind a flag that can be compared against the previous version.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a stock trading platform

A stock trading platform combines a real-time market data system with an order
lifecycle system, and the two have very different demands. Market data is a
high-volume broadcast that must reach clients with minimal latency; orders are
low-volume but must be validated, risk-checked, matched, and settled correctly.
I would build a gateway in front of market feed, order, matching, risk, and
portfolio services, with a ledger for settlement, a price cache for quotes, and
an Orders DB. Compliance and reporting are baked into the same pipeline so that
every order event is captured once, in order, and never reconstructed from
screenshots.

A trader places an order through the app; the gateway submits it to the order
service, which validates and persists it, then passes it through risk checks
before the matching engine executes it against incoming or resting liquidity. On
fill, the portfolio service updates positions and the ledger settles cash, and
the trader receives a fill notification. Quotes stream in from the market data
feed through a cache to the app, so the displayed price is always available even
during bursts. Market orders, limit orders, and stop orders are all state
machines over the same base order record, so the matching engine treats them
uniformly.

The design must tolerate partial failure without losing money or orders. Order
placement is idempotent via client order ids, matching is single-threaded per
instrument to preserve price-time priority, and the ledger is append-only with
reconciliation against the broker and clearing house. The tradeoff is latency
versus control: batching and caching hurt latency but reduce cost, so the hot
order path is kept lean while analytics and reporting run asynchronously.

### Q2. How do you stream live market data to clients?

Market data is a broadcast problem: every subscriber wants the same quotes, at
roughly the same time, and the volume is enormous because prices tick
continuously during trading hours. I would use a multicast-style fan-out at the
infrastructure level, with a market data feed service that normalizes data from
exchanges and republishes it over WebSockets to connected clients, with
throttling to protect both the exchange feed and client bandwidth. Regulators
require fairness, so the fan-out must not systematically favor one subscriber
over another in latency terms.

Clients rarely need every tick. I would implement subscription-based channels: a
client subscribes to symbols, and the gateway pushes only updates for those
symbols, batched by the millisecond so a burst of ticks becomes one message. A
price cache holds the last price per symbol so a newly connecting client can
snapshot current prices instantly, then apply live deltas, avoiding a full
history transfer on every reconnect. Replay buffers per symbol let a slow
consumer catch up without reconnecting, at the cost of memory.

Reliability matters because a stale quote is worse than no quote. Each message
carries a sequence number per symbol, and the client detects gaps and requests a
resync from the cache. Lossy compression and batching reduce bandwidth but add
latency, so I would tune the tradeoff per data tier: full-fidelity for trading
terminals, aggregated streams for casual apps. Monitoring tracks gap rates and
staleness per symbol, alerting when a feed lags. Delayed quotes for
non-subscribers are served from the same cache with a timestamp watermark.

### Q3. How do you place and match orders with low latency?

Matching is where correctness and speed collide. To preserve price-time
priority, I would keep a per-symbol order book in memory, single-threaded per
symbol so there are no locks and no races, with a matching engine that walks the
book by price and then by arrival sequence. Orders arrive through the gateway,
are validated and risk-checked, then handed to the matching engine, which either
fills them immediately against resting liquidity or books them as resting
orders. Order types with exotic conditions are compiled into the same book logic
so one fast path serves all of them.

Latency is dominated by the number of hops, so I would co-locate the matching
engine close to the exchange, run it in-process with the order service, and keep
the book entirely in memory with write-ahead logging for crash recovery.
Persistence is asynchronous relative to the match decision: the match happens
first, the durable log confirms it, and the Orders DB catches up, because
waiting for a synchronous database commit would destroy latency. Network
reliability comes from the gateway acking each order with an exchange-validated
id before matching proceeds.

Scale comes from sharding by symbol: each symbol has exactly one owner at any
time, and the ownership table is replicated so failover moves a symbol to a hot
standby within seconds. The tradeoff is that cross-symbol features like
portfolio-level netting need a separate layer that aggregates post-trade. Cancel
and replace operations reuse the same book, and because the matching engine is
deterministic, replaying the log reproduces the exact sequence of fills for
audits.

### Q4. How do you manage risk and prevent losses?

Risk checks gate every order before it can match. I would implement a
multi-layer risk framework: pre-trade checks reject orders that exceed buying
power, violate position limits, or fail pattern-day-trading rules; real-time
monitoring catches runaway behavior like rapid-fire churn; and post-trade
surveillance detects anomalies after the fact. Each layer runs on a risk service
with its own fast path so the check itself does not become the bottleneck. Fraud
overlays like credential anomalies and unusual geolocation feed the same gate
before funds can leave the account.

Because a trader's exposure depends on current prices, the risk service consumes
the same price stream as trading and maintains a live portfolio valuation.
Buying-power checks are computed against mark-to-market equity with haircuts for
volatile instruments, and orders are either rejected or partially allowed. The
design principle is fail-closed: if the risk service is unreachable, the order
service rejects orders rather than guessing, because the cost of an uncaught
loss far exceeds the cost of a rejected trade. Intraday limits on gross exposure
stop compounding losses from a single bad strategy.

Risk also spans market events. Circuit breakers at the platform level halt
trading in a symbol or account when conditions spike, and margin calls are
automated within defined bounds. The tradeoff is strictness versus friction:
tight risk reduces losses but also blocks legitimate clients, so limits are
configurable per account class with escalation paths. Everything is logged, so a
disputed rejection can be reconstructed and explained precisely. Simulated
stress scenarios run nightly to validate that the limits would have held on
historical crash days.

### Q5. How do you keep portfolio balances consistent?

Portfolio balances must always reconcile with the ledger, so I would make the
ledger the single source of truth for cash and positions, and derive the
displayed portfolio from it rather than storing a separate balance. Every trade
produces a pair of ledger entries (cash debited or credited and position
changed) written in one atomic transaction, so a crash mid-trade cannot leave a
half-applied position. Dividends, fees, and interest are the same kind of entry,
just with different sources. Currency conversions and corporate actions like
splits are modeled as explicit entries, keeping the math visible and auditable.

The displayed balance can then be a materialized view computed from the ledger
with an idempotency key per entry, recomputed on demand and cached. Concurrency
is handled by serializing writes per account, so two simultaneous sell orders
cannot both spend the same cash. The tradeoff is that recomputation can be
expensive for an account with years of history, so I would keep a running
balance per account with nightly full reconciliation against the ledger and
against broker records. Caching invalidation is keyed on the account's entry
sequence, so a new entry invalidates exactly the cached balances that matter.

Consistency failures surface as a difference between the ledger and the broker
or clearing-house statement. A reconciliation job compares the two and flags
every discrepancy, and because the ledger is append-only with hashes, the
platform can prove exactly which entries are authoritative. The user experience
is built on this guarantee: available cash, buying power, and positions all
derive from the same reconciled state, so a trader never sees two numbers that
disagree.

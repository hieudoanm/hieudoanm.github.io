## Answers

### Q1. Design a reviews platform

A reviews platform pairs a catalog of business listings with a stream of
user-generated reviews, and the read path dominates by orders of magnitude. I
would build it around a business service that owns listing data, a review
service that owns individual reviews, and a rating aggregator that maintains
per-business statistics. Review verification screens submissions for
authenticity, the ranking service orders reviews by usefulness, and the search
index makes both listings and review content discoverable. A listing cache
serves the hot profile page, and a reviews database is the system of record for
every review and rating.

The write path goes through verification before a review is visible. The user
submits through the app, the gateway forwards it, and the verification service
checks for evidence the reviewer actually transacted, such as a check-in,
booking, or order. Verified reviews are accepted, then the rating aggregator
recomputes the business's average, the cache refreshes, and the ranking service
scores the review for display order. Unverified or suspect submissions are held,
reviewed, and either rejected or published with a lower trust signal. Reads hit
the cache and search index, so a popular listing page is served without touching
the review database.

The central tradeoff is between the integrity of ratings and the volume of
reviews. Strict verification raises quality but suppresses the volume that makes
a reviews platform useful, so the design uses tiered verification rather than a
binary gate. The system is also multi-tenant in spirit: a business owner sees
only their listing, so every query is scoped by business id, and the database is
sharded by that id to keep a single listing's reviews colocated. The
architecture accepts eventual consistency between a new review and its reflected
aggregate, closing the gap with cache refresh and background re-aggregation.

### Q2. How do you aggregate ratings fairly?

A naive average is easy to game and easy to mislead. A business with three
five-star reviews should not outrank one with a hundred reviews, and one angry
coordinated campaign should not drag a great business down. I would compute a
Bayesian aggregate that combines the observed rating with a prior: a weighted
average where the weight scales with review count, so small samples regress
toward the population mean. This produces a stable score that converges to the
true mean as reviews accumulate and is hard to move with a handful of fake
reviews.

Fairness also requires handling outliers. I would detect review bombs, where a
burst of one-star reviews arrives in a short window from suspicious accounts,
and exclude or downweight them pending review. Repeated reviews from the same
user on the same business are collapsed to one contribution. The rating display
should show more than a single number: the distribution histogram, the count,
and recency are all honest signals, and I would expose them so users can judge
the score for themselves. The aggregate is versioned and recomputed on events,
not on read, so the cache serves a consistent number.

The aggregator must also be defensible to business owners, who are the
platform's paying customers. Every displayed number is derived from a
deterministic, documented formula over stored reviews, so the platform can
explain why a score is what it is. Recomputations are idempotent and replayable
from the review database, which lets the team rerun history when the formula
changes. I would separate the headline score from contextual aggregates such as
recent-12-month rating, because a business that improved should not be judged
forever by its early years. The tradeoff is that Bayesian aggregation is less
intuitive than an average, so the UI documents how the number is computed.

### Q3. How do you verify reviews are authentic?

Authenticity verification is about evidence, reputation, and anomaly detection,
and it runs before a review becomes visible. The strongest signal is proof of a
real transaction: a booking, check-in, order, or reservation tied to the user
and the business. I would structure the platform so transactions flow through it
and emit verifiable events, so a review can reference one. A verified tag on the
review communicates the evidence level, and verified reviews are weighted more
heavily in aggregates. For platforms without first-party transactions, the
verification service looks for indirect evidence and assigns a trust score.

Account and behavior signals complement transaction evidence. New accounts
writing a first review of a never-reviewed business, accounts that review many
competitors in one session, and users sharing an IP or device fingerprint all
look suspicious. The verification service scores these signals and combines them
with transaction evidence into a trust decision. I would maintain a reputation
system where long-lived, active users with a history of accepted reviews
accumulate trust, which lets their future reviews publish quickly while unknown
users face more scrutiny. Blocks are shared across the platform so a known
abusive account cannot start over trivially.

Anomaly detection catches the coordinated attacks that individual signals miss.
I would run streaming detection over review volume per business, flagging
bursts, clustering of identical text, and ratings that diverge sharply from the
prior. Flagged reviews are routed to human review with the evidence surfaced,
because automated systems alone are too brittle. The tradeoff is that aggressive
verification suppresses legitimate reviews from new users, so the false-positive
cost is managed by making rejections appealable and by preferring to hold rather
than delete. All decisions are logged so the verification policy is auditable
and tunable.

### Q4. How do you power review search and ranking?

Search over reviews has two distinct workloads. The first is finding a business
by name, category, location, and attributes, which the search index serves with
filters over structured fields and geo-coordinates. The second is surfacing the
most useful reviews for a given listing, which is a ranking problem rather than
a relevance problem. I would use the search index for both: business documents
contain listing metadata and aggregated rating signals, while review documents
carry the review text, rating, and verification metadata. The index is updated
asynchronously from review and business events.

Review ranking orders the reviews on a listing page by usefulness, not just
recency. A score combines recency, verified status, the rating's agreement with
the aggregate, and votes from other users on whether the review was helpful.
This surfaces informative reviews while letting new content still appear through
a recency boost. I would personalize the ranking modestly: a user's own review
and reviews from friends rank first, and text is highlighted when it matches the
user's search terms. The ranking model is served as a score function over
indexed features, so it can be tuned without reindexing.

Scale is managed with facets and result caps. Business search returns fewer than
a hundred results with the aggregate rating embedded in each result document, so
the listing page needs no join to display stars. Review search within a business
is bounded by pagination and caching. The listing cache stores the top-N ranked
reviews for hot businesses, which serves the vast majority of page views, while
colder businesses query the index directly. The tradeoff is index freshness
versus cost; a short reindex interval keeps new reviews visible within seconds,
which is good enough for a workload where hours-old reviews rarely change user
decisions.

### Q5. How do you handle review bias?

Review bias appears in two directions: the reviewer set is not representative,
and the platform's own systems can amplify or suppress certain reviews. Extreme
experiences are over-represented because people who are furious or delighted are
the most likely to write, so raw averages drift away from the typical
experience. I would counter this by weighting contributions and by soliciting
reviews systematically: after a confirmed transaction, a prompt reaches the
reviewer, which brings in the middle of the distribution that would otherwise
stay silent. A recency-weighted aggregate also reduces the influence of stale
reviews that no longer describe the business.

Gaming bias is the second concern. Coordinated positive campaigns and
competitive negative campaigns both distort scores, and the verification service
feeds the aggregator, so suspicious reviews are excluded before they move the
average. I would also damp the influence of extreme ratings from users who rate
everything one or five stars, since their scale is not calibrated to the general
population. This must be handled transparently: users see why a score is
computed the way it is, and business owners see which reviews were excluded and
why, so the system remains defensible rather than mysterious.

Platform design choices also create bias. Sort order determines what users read,
so a ranking that over-weights sensational reviews shapes perception; I would
surface verified reviews and diverse perspectives in the top positions. Featured
reviews and awards must come from a documented policy, and the display of the
distribution histogram helps users see the full picture rather than a single
number. I would run ongoing measurement of rating drift against external signals
such as transaction satisfaction surveys to detect when the aggregate has moved
away from reality. The tradeoff is that bias correction is inherently a series
of judgment calls, so the platform documents the policies and revises them from
measured outcomes.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a game matchmaking system

A matchmaking system takes players who want to play and groups them into a
balanced match. A player joins through the app, and the API Gateway enqueues
them into the Matchmaking Queue. The Skill Rating component maintains each
player's rating, typically a version of Elo or Glicko stored in the Rating
Store, and the queue organizes players by that rating. Parties join as groups,
so the Party Service feeds pre-formed teams into the queue rather than
individuals. The Matchmaker continuously scans the queue, selects a set of
players whose ratings form a fair match, creates a Match Room, and the
Notification Service prompts everyone to accept. Completed match records are
written to the Matches DB.

The core tension in matchmaking is quality versus time. Waiting longer makes
better matches possible, because the queue accumulates more candidates at the
same skill, but players abandon if the wait is too long. The system therefore
treats queue time as a tunable target and relaxes the match criteria as wait
time grows. The Matchmaker searches for the best available grouping that meets
the current tolerance, rather than the globally best possible grouping, so the
search is bounded and the queue drains on schedule.

The system also has to respect the social structure of the game. Players arrive
solo, in pairs, or in full parties, and the matchmaker must place a party as a
unit or break the party's expectation. Rating is only the primary signal, not
the only one: region, latency, game mode, and the player's current win or loss
streak all influence which opponents are acceptable. The architecture separates
these concerns, with rating in the Skill Rating service, grouping in the Party
Service, and the decision policy in the Matchmaker, so each dimension can evolve
independently.

### Q2. How do you build a ranked queue?

The ranked queue is not a plain FIFO; it is an index of waiting players keyed by
the properties that matter for matching. The Matchmaking Queue maintains players
grouped by game mode, region, and rating band, so the Matchmaker can search
within a tight slice instead of scanning all waiting players. Joining is an
insert into the appropriate bucket, and leaving is a remove, which happens when
a player cancels, times out, or is drafted into a match. The queue must handle
both operations efficiently at the rates the game produces them, which are
spiky: queueing spikes when an event starts or a patch drops.

Queue integrity comes from the rating store being the source of truth. The Skill
Rating component reads each player's current rating and volatility from the
Rating Store at enqueue time, so the queue never works with stale ratings, and
updates the rating only after a match completes. A player cannot enter the same
queue twice, and a party is enqueued as a single unit with a representative
rating, so the queue treats the group atomically. Every queue action is
timestamped, because the waiting time since enqueue is the primary input to how
much the system relaxes its standards.

The queue also has to protect itself from abuse and from its own popularity.
Duplicate enqueues, rapid leave and rejoin, and players dodging into the same
queue repeatedly are detected and throttled. When the queue is large, the
Matchmaker drains it in parallel by partitioning the rating space, so different
rating bands are matched independently, and the queue service scales by sharding
on rating band. The queue is ephemeral by design: its state lives in memory and
can be reconstructed from the authoritative rating store if a process fails.

### Q3. How do you balance teams by skill?

Team balance is the goal of matching in team-based games: the two sides should
have roughly equal total skill so the match is competitive. The Matchmaker
scores candidate groupings against a balance function that combines each
player's rating and rating uncertainty into an expected win-probability model.
For a 5v5 match, the score is the difference between the two teams' predicted
win probabilities, and the matchmaker seeks the grouping closest to fifty
percent. A one-sided match is penalized regardless of which side is stronger,
because neither the favored nor the underdog enjoys a blowout.

Balance interacts with party structure. A party of strong players has a combined
skill that is not simply the sum of its members, since coordination adds
effective skill beyond individual ratings, so the model adjusts party skill
upward. The system must decide whether to place the party's full strength on one
team and compensate on the other side, or to match strong parties against other
strong parties. The preference is to match groups of comparable structure,
because solos against a coordinated party are unfair in ways rating alone does
not capture.

Balance is enforced with constraints rather than optimization. The system
defines hard limits, such as the maximum allowed rating spread within a team or
across teams, and the Matchmaker only accepts groupings within those limits.
When the queue cannot produce a balanced match within the time budget, the
limits are widened gradually rather than abandoned, and a match is never formed
with a spread so large that it guarantees a one-sided game. The resulting match
composition is logged, so the matchmaker's decisions can be audited against the
win rate outcomes.

### Q4. How do you handle queue time targets?

Queue time targets convert a quality problem into a control problem. The system
defines an expected wait for each mode and rating band, and the Matchmaker
expands its search in steps as players wait longer. Early in the queue, the
matchmaker searches only the player's own rating band and requires the tightest
balance. After the first target, it widens to adjacent bands, then farther, and
finally relaxes balance and region constraints. The expansion is a ladder of
tolerances, so a player who has waited the longest gets the most relaxed
treatment and is never starved by a steady inflow of new, better-matched
players.

The queue time target is enforced through the matchmaking policy, not through
guesswork. The system monitors the actual distribution of wait times per mode
and band, and adjusts the ladder when waits miss the target, for example by
widening faster during low-traffic hours when the queue is naturally thin.
Player impatience is modeled as well: the wait is displayed with an expected
range, and players leave when the range is exceeded, which raises the effective
demand for faster matching. The matchmaker also prioritizes the oldest players
within an acceptable band, so everyone makes progress.

There is a deliberate floor under how much the system will compromise. If the
queue is so thin that even the most relaxed criteria cannot form a match, the
system refuses to fabricate one and instead returns players to the lobby with a
clear message. This protects the other target, match quality, from being
destroyed by the queue time target. The two targets are therefore jointly
monitored: the system tracks how many matches were formed at each tolerance
level and how those matches played out, so the ladder can be tuned to balance
wait against outcome quality.

### Q5. How do you avoid bad matches?

A bad match is one that players would rather not have played, and the design
avoids them by defining quality before matching and verifying it after. Quality
starts with the signals: rating, rating uncertainty, region, mode, and party
composition. High-uncertainty players are matched against each other rather than
against stable veterans, because a player with no rating history should not
decide a match for everyone else. The Matchmaker refuses groupings that violate
hard constraints, and the softening of those constraints under queue pressure is
capped so that the time ladder can never produce a game that is obviously
unfair.

Bad matches are also avoided structurally by how parties and streaks are
handled. A party entering as a unit is only matched against parties or players
that keep the expected win probability near balance, and a player on a long win
or loss streak is treated as having shifted skill, so the system does not pair a
tilted player into a guaranteed loss. The matchmaker avoids repeatedly placing
the same players against each other when the queue has alternatives, because
lopsided rematches feel broken even if the ratings say they are fair.

The loop closes with measurement. Every match is recorded in the Matches DB with
the predicted win probability and the actual outcome, so the system can compute
calibration: does a predicted sixty-forty match actually produce a sixty-forty
outcome? Systematic gaps indicate stale ratings or missing signals, and feed
tuning of the rating update and the balance function. Player surveys and
abandonment rates are tracked as soft signals, and a rising abandon rate in a
mode is treated as a quality regression even when the numerical balance looks
fine. Avoiding bad matches is an ongoing calibration problem, not a one-time
rule set.

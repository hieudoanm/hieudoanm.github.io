## Answers

### Q1. Design a live quiz / trivia game

A live quiz game is a real-time multiplayer experience with one host and many
players, all moving through the same questions at the same time. The host
creates a game through the Lobby Service, which returns a join code that players
use to enter the Game Room. The room is the core state container: it holds the
roster, the current question, the phase of the game, and the clock. When the
host starts the game, the room loads questions from the Question Bank and
broadcasts each one to every connected player, then collects their answers
through the Answer Collector, grades them in the Scoring Engine, and publishes
the updated Live Leaderboard. Game results are saved to the Games DB when the
room finishes.

The central challenge is synchronization. Every player must see the same
question start and end at the same instant, because fairness depends on everyone
having the same answering window. The room therefore owns an authoritative game
clock, and the clients are treated as renderers that display server-sent state
rather than as participants who advance the game. The server decides question
start, the answer deadline, and the transition to the next question, and pushes
those transitions to all clients. This removes any dependence on client clocks,
which drift and can be tampered with.

The architecture separates the control plane from the data plane. The Lobby
Service and the room life cycle are lightweight control operations, while the
broadcast of questions and the flood of answers are the high-bandwidth data
plane. Keeping these apart means a room that is under heavy answer load does not
block the creation of new lobbies, and a slow player's connection does not stall
the room. The room itself is an in-memory state machine with durable snapshots,
so losing a process does not lose the entire game.

### Q2. How do you synchronize questions across players?

Synchronization starts with an authoritative room clock. The Game Room maintains
a single timeline for the current question, with phases such as countdown,
question displayed, answer window, and reveal. The room broadcasts a phase event
with the current timestamp to all players, and the client renders against that
server timeline rather than its own wall clock. When a player joins mid-game,
the room sends a state snapshot containing the current phase, the question, and
the remaining time, so a late joiner is brought exactly in sync. Because the
client does not advance the game on its own, drift between players is bounded by
network latency rather than by accumulated client error.

The broadcast mechanism is a real-time push channel, typically a WebSocket
federation or a dedicated pub-sub bus scoped to the room. The room publishes
each event once, and the delivery layer fans it out to every connection in that
room. The system does not attempt to make arrival time equal; instead, it makes
the game decision on the server clock, so players who receive an event slightly
late still answer against the same deadline. This is the critical fairness
property: the answering window is defined by server time, not by when each
player's device rendered the question.

The room also reconciles state after any disruption. If a player's connection
drops and reconnects, the room replays the current phase and state, so the
player is not lost from the game. If the room process fails, a standby restores
the latest snapshot and clients resubscribe. Synchronization therefore has two
layers: the steady-state broadcast that keeps everyone on the same question, and
the recovery path that brings stragglers and crashed rooms back to the shared
timeline without restarting the game for everyone.

### Q3. How do you handle answer latency and correctness?

Answers arrive on a tight deadline, and the design must separate the network
layer from the game logic. Players submit answers through the app to the Answer
Collector, which is a per-room ingest point that stamps each answer with the
server time it arrived. The deadline check is applied here: the answer is
accepted only if its server timestamp is before the close time of the current
question. Because the deadline is enforced on the server, a fast connection or a
slow one does not change what counts, and a player who guesses the timing cannot
extend their window by manipulating the client. Timestamps are monotonic per
room and consistent with the room clock.

Correctness is computed in the Scoring Engine after the window closes, not as
answers arrive. This has two benefits. First, it decouples scoring from the
flood of submissions, so the room can accept answers at peak rate without
computing on the hot path. Second, it makes scoring deterministic and
replayable: the graded result for a question is a pure function of the accepted
answer set, so a reprocessed question yields identical scores. Grading also
accounts for timing, since many quiz games award bonus points for speed, and the
server timestamp is the only timing input the engine trusts.

The system tolerates partial and malformed input. Missing answers are graded as
incorrect rather than erroring, because a player whose answer never arrived must
still get a score for the question. Duplicate answers from retries are
deduplicated by player and question, with the first accepted submission winning.
Late answers are logged separately from the graded set, so the team can measure
how many players are being cut off by the deadline and tune the window.
Correctness is verified end-to-end: the reveal shows the key, the player's
answer, and their score, so a discrepancy surfaces immediately to the user
rather than silently persisting.

### Q4. How do you compute scores and leaderboards in real-time?

Scoring is an incremental aggregation over each room. After a question closes,
the Scoring Engine grades all accepted answers and produces a score delta per
player, then applies the deltas to the running total held in the room state. The
Live Leaderboard is maintained as an in-memory sorted structure per room,
updated with each question's results, and broadcast to all players after the
reveal. The design deliberately avoids recomputing the leaderboard from scratch,
because that would make cost grow with the number of questions and players,
whereas incremental update keeps the cost constant per question regardless of
the game length.

Consistency between the displayed board and the authoritative score comes from a
single writer. The room is the only component that updates scores, so the
leaderboard cannot diverge from the score state even though many clients receive
broadcasts. The board is stored as a snapshot, not as a stream, so a
reconnecting player receives the current ordering immediately. At game end, the
final scores and board order are written to the Games DB as the durable record,
and the room can be discarded.

The leaderboard also has to handle ties and per-question variation. Ties are
broken deterministically, for example by completion time or by a stable player
ID ordering, so two clients that render the same snapshot show the same ranks.
Speed bonuses mean the board order can change substantially between questions,
which is expected and desirable, and the broadcast after each reveal is what
animates the live board for all players. Because the leaderboard is derived
state, it is recomputable from the per-question results, which makes
auditability and post-game reporting simple.

### Q5. How do you scale to many concurrent lobbies?

The system scales by treating each room as an independent, small unit of work
and routing players to the room's host process. A Lobby Service tracks which
process owns which room, so a player joining with a code is directed to the
correct server, and the host's game traffic stays collocated with its players.
Rooms do not share state, so the workload is naturally parallel: adding capacity
is adding room-hosting processes, and the only cross-room structures, the Lobby
Service and the Question Bank, are shared but cheap and horizontally replicable.

The main scaling risk is a flood of concurrent games and the associated
connection fan-out. Each player holds a long-lived connection, so the connection
layer is the resource that runs out first. The design separates connection
termination from room logic, letting a front tier hold connections and forward
to the room host, and it sizes rooms against a predictable per-player bandwidth
so capacity planning is arithmetic: players per server, rooms per server,
servers per region. The Question Bank is read from a replicated cache, since
many concurrent rooms request the same popular quizzes.

Isolation is what makes the numbers hold. A single misbehaving room, one with
thousands of players or a flood of retries, must not degrade other rooms, so the
room hosts enforce per-room resource limits and a global admission policy on
lobby creation. Load shedding at the front tier keeps the connection layer alive
when demand spikes, dropping new joins with a clear error rather than degrading
existing games. The Games DB is written as rooms finish, which smooths the write
load, since the moment a game ends is spread randomly rather than synchronized
across all games.

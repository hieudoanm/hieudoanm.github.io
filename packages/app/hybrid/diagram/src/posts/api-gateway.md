## Answers

### Q1. Design an API gateway

An API gateway is the single entry point for client traffic into a microservices
architecture. It terminates client connections, presents a stable external API,
and forwards requests to internal services. The gateway decouples clients from
service topology: services can move, split, or be renamed without changing
client code, and cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting,
TLS, request routing, logging, and response aggregation are implemented once
instead of in every service. Clients talk to the gateway over public HTTP while
internal calls happen on a private network.

A gateway typically sits behind a load balancer and is itself stateless, so it
scales horizontally behind a DNS or LB layer. It holds the route table (a
mapping from path or host to service name) in memory and fetches it from a
config store on startup, and it keeps connection pools to backends to avoid
re-establishing sockets per request. Two common flavors exist: the edge gateway,
which faces external clients and owns auth, TLS, and rate limiting, and the
backend-for-frontend (BFF), which is specialized per client platform and
aggregates the exact calls a given screen needs. The flavor choice matters: a
single generic edge gateway is simple, while BFFs reduce payload sizes and make
per-platform policies possible at the cost of more moving parts.

Key design concerns are latency overhead, single point of failure, and
throughput. Every request pays one extra hop, so routing and filtering logic
must be cheap, and the gateway should stream responses rather than buffer whole
bodies. Availability is handled with stateless replicas, health checks, and
circuit breakers so a degraded gateway does not take down all traffic.
Throughput is protected by separating the control path (route updates, rate
limit rules, config) from the data path, and by pushing route data to gateways
so a config-store outage does not stall request forwarding.

### Q2. How do you route requests to services?

Routing is a two-stage lookup. The gateway first matches the incoming request
against route rules keyed by host, path prefix, HTTP method, and sometimes
headers or query parameters. Each rule points at a service name, and the gateway
then resolves that name to a concrete set of instances, typically through
service discovery or the configured load balancer, applying weights, canary
labels, or environment overrides. Matching uses longest-prefix semantics on the
path so specific routes take precedence over generic ones, and the rules are
compiled into a trie at startup so per-request matching is a handful of memory
comparisons rather than a scan of every rule.

Routes are versioned with the rest of the configuration, and changes are
distributed by a control plane that pushes the new route table to every gateway
replica. This matters because a routing change is effectively a deployment: a
wrong rule can blackhole traffic or send it to the wrong service. Gateways keep
the route table in memory and apply updates via a change stream, each replica
independently, avoiding a thundering herd on config reload. Timeouts, retries,
and circuit-breaking policies are attached per route rather than globally, so a
slow downstream service only degrades the routes that depend on it.

Edge cases include overlapping rules, trailing slashes, case sensitivity, and
query strings, so the gateway normalizes URLs before matching. Path rewriting
(like stripping an API version prefix) and header manipulation (forwarding only
allowlisted headers and injecting trace IDs) are part of routing. For safe
rollouts, routes support shadowing: a percentage of traffic is copied to a new
version without affecting responses, building confidence before full cutover.

### Q3. How do you enforce auth and rate limits?

Auth is enforced as a filter in the gateway's middleware chain, before routing
and forwarding. The gateway validates tokens, checking JWT signature and expiry
or session validity against a validation service, enforces scopes and
permissions, and injects the caller identity (user id, tenant, roles) as headers
forwarded to downstream services. Offloading auth to the gateway means services
trust the gateway-issued identity and never re-implement token validation, but
it concentrates risk: a bug in the filter affects every API, so the filter stays
small, well-tested, and its crypto dependencies updated aggressively.

Rate limiting must be cheap and distributed. Because the gateway fleet is
stateless and horizontally scaled, a local in-memory token bucket only works per
instance; distributed limits require a shared store such as Redis, where the
gateway atomically decrements a counter per key (user, tenant, IP, or a
composite). The tradeoff is latency versus accuracy: a Redis round trip per
request adds overhead, so gateways typically keep a local cached allowance and
reconcile with the central store asynchronously, accepting that limits are
approximate over short bursts. Bucket dimensions (window size, burst allowance)
are configurable per plan tier.

Failures in these paths must fail safely. An auth outage fails closed for
sensitive endpoints, while a rate-limit store outage uses local fail-open with
degraded limits so it does not block all traffic. Every rejection and allowed
request is logged with caller identity, route, and outcome, so operations can
trace abuse, tune limits, and prove compliance after the fact.

### Q4. How do you aggregate multiple services?

Aggregation exists because a single client screen often needs data from several
services. The gateway's aggregator issues parallel downstream calls, joins their
results, and composes a single response, cutting client round trips and shifting
fan-out into the infrastructure. The aggregator models the request in terms of
the data each screen needs, which is why the BFF pattern fits well here, and it
issues downstream calls concurrently, bounded by a max concurrency and a global
timeout.

The hard part is error semantics. If four of five downstream calls succeed and
one fails, what does the client receive? The usual approach distinguishes
critical data (fail the whole request) from non-critical enrichments (return
partial data with a degraded flag or omit the field). Each downstream call gets
its own timeout, retry budget, and circuit breaker, so a single slow service
delays only the fields it provides. Responses are streamed where possible so the
client receives the first chunk before all backends have answered.

Aggregation introduces the risk of latency multiplication and partial death.
Circuit breakers are essential: once a downstream service exceeds a failure
threshold, the aggregator fails fast instead of hanging on timeouts. Idempotency
keys and caching of stable reads (catalog, pricing, profiles) reduce downstream
call volume. The aggregator is also deliberately scoped — hiding too much logic
in the gateway recreates the monolith — so it performs composition and joining
only, never business rules.

### Q5. How do you handle partial failures?

Partial failures are the norm in a distributed system, and the gateway is where
they surface because it fans out to many services. The first defense is per-call
isolation: each downstream request has its own timeout, retry budget, and
circuit breaker, so a hung or failing service cannot consume the gateway's
resources indefinitely. The circuit breaker trips after a configurable error
rate, then fails fast for a cooldown window with a cheap fallback response
rather than allowing requests to pile up.

The second defense is graceful degradation. When a non-critical dependency
fails, the gateway returns partial data with a status flag indicating
degradation instead of failing the entire request. For critical dependencies,
the gateway can serve a stale cached response when freshness cannot be
guaranteed. Every fallback path is logged and monitored, and circuit-breaker
state is surfaced in dashboards so operations sees exactly which dependency is
degraded at a glance.

The final layer limits blast radius: per-route concurrency limits prevent one
hot client from exhausting the gateway's worker pool, bulkheaded connection
pools prevent a slow backend from holding all sockets, and health-based load
shedding lets the gateway reject or downgrade non-critical traffic when it is
overloaded. Crucially, failures are made visible through structured logs,
metrics per route and status, and trace IDs propagated to downstream calls,
because an unobserved partial failure is indistinguishable from a success when
debugging an outage.

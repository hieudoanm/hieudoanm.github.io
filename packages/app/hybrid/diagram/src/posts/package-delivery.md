## Answers

### Q1. Design a package delivery / shipping system

A package delivery system has two faces: the customer-facing shipping product
(create shipment, generate label, track) and the operations backbone (sorting
hubs, routes, and the delivery fleet). I would build it as a gateway in front of
shipment, label, sorting, tracking, and route-planning services, with a
Shipments DB and a notification service. Shipment creation is a write-heavy but
low-latency flow; tracking is a read-heavy append-only flow; and sorting and
routing are batch-oriented workloads. The label is the physical handshake
between digital and physical systems, so it encodes a machine-readable
identifier that survives printing and reprinting.

When a sender creates a shipment through the app, the shipment service registers
it, the label generator produces a scannable label, and the sorting engine
computes the network path through hubs. From there the route planner assigns the
package to a delivery route, the carrier scans events during delivery, and the
tracking service appends those events for the customer. The sender can then
query tracking through the same app, so the read path and the operational path
share one data model. Return shipments reuse the same pipeline with the roles of
sender and receiver swapped, which avoids a second bespoke workflow.

I would separate the hot customer path from the operational pipeline with
queues: shipment creation publishes events consumed by sorting and routing
workers, so a surge of holiday parcels does not make the API slower. The
tradeoff is that route assignments and ETAs are computed asynchronously and
therefore slightly stale, which is acceptable because tracking shows real-time
scans as the authoritative progress signal. Pricing and dimension validation
happen at creation, so the label always reflects the contracted rate.

### Q2. How do you generate and scan tracking events at scale?

Tracking events arrive from scanning devices on handhelds, conveyors, and gate
scanners, and they can spike enormously during sortation. I would ingest them
through an event queue so that a scan burst decouples from downstream
processing, then append events to a tracking store optimized for the two access
patterns: fetch the full timeline for one package, and compute the latest status
per package for dashboards. Scan latency budgets are tight because a stopped
conveyor means the whole hub waits, so the ingest path must be synchronous
enough to avoid drops but never block sortation.

Each scan carries a package id, location, timestamp, and status code, and is
deduplicated by a unique event id because scanners retry when networks are
flaky. I would partition the tracking store by package id so a single package's
timeline lives on one node, and store recent status in a cache for fast lookups.
Retention tiers keep the last 90 days hot and archive older events to cheaper
object storage, since full histories are rarely queried. Dead-letter handling
flags scans that cannot be matched to a shipment for manual repair rather than
silently dropping them.

The read side matters as much as the write side: customers poll the app, so
tracking endpoints must be cheap. I would serve the latest status from cache and
fetch the full timeline from the store only when requested. Event ordering is
preserved per package by writing to an append-only log keyed by sequence, which
also gives the audit trail needed when a package is lost and a claim must be
investigated. Analytics over the event stream drive reliability metrics like
scan timeliness by hub.

### Q3. How do you route packages through sorting hubs?

Sorting hubs are a network problem: a package must be moved from origin to
destination through one or more hub transfers, and each hub can only process so
many parcels per hour. I would model the network as a directed graph of hubs and
lane capacities, then solve routing as a shortest-path problem where the cost is
a blend of distance, transit time, and lane capacity headroom. The sorting
engine computes the route when the label is generated and stamps it on the label
data. Hubs operate on a schedule of waves, so the route must also respect cutoff
times; a package missing its wave waits for the next one rather than delaying
the whole trailer.

Because capacity changes in real time as hubs back up, I would recompute routes
periodically rather than once. A central orchestrator publishes hub load and
lane health, and the sorting engine reroutes packages that have not yet left
their origin. Priority tiers (express versus standard) are embedded as weight in
the cost function, so express parcels are not stuck behind bulk standard volume
on a saturated lane. Overnight redistribution moves packages between zones only
when lane cost falls, keeping the plan adaptive but stable.

At peak, solving per-package shortest paths is wasteful; most packages in a
region share the same route, so I would compute routes per origin-destination
pair and cache them, then adjust only the edges near saturation. The tradeoff is
that cached routes lag current conditions, so the orchestrator must detect a
jammed hub and invalidate the affected pairs quickly. The label's
machine-readable route id lets sorters at each hub act on the plan without any
real-time dependency.

### Q4. How do you plan last-mile delivery routes?

Last mile is the most expensive leg, and the route planner must sequence stops
so that each driver respects time windows and capacity while travel distance
stays low. I would feed the planner a set of packages assigned to a zone, each
with a delivery window and a location, and solve a vehicle routing problem with
capacity constraints. For the typical zone of tens to hundreds of stops, a
cluster-first, route-second heuristic is fast enough and near-optimal. Capacity
here includes package volume and vehicle type, so the planner matches stops to
the right van or bike and respects driver shift hours.

Routes change during the day: a customer redirects, a stop is impossible, or a
package was misloaded. I would make the route mutable and re-optimize the
remaining stops when a driver reports a deviation, pushing the updated sequence
to the driver's handheld. The driver app is also the source of scan events that
flow into tracking, so the route planner and the tracking pipeline share the
same stop identifiers. Proof-of-delivery photos and signatures arrive as the
last scan of each stop and close the loop for claims and notifications.

The tradeoff is optimization time versus responsiveness: a perfect global
solution is too slow to recompute mid-route, while a purely greedy plan degrades
quality. I would solve each zone independently so zones scale horizontally, and
use travel time estimates from historical data rather than live traffic so plans
are stable. Delivery windows promised to customers are soft constraints in the
planner; the system tries hard to meet them and uses the same data to set honest
ETAs. Rain, traffic, and construction are absorbed by the re-optimizer rather
than by inflating every estimate.

### Q5. How do you handle delays and customer notifications?

Delays are inevitable, and the goal is to convert a silent failure into a
managed promise. I would compute an expected delivery time from the route plan
and predicted transit times, then compare actual scan times against it in the
tracking pipeline. When a package misses a commit, a delay engine updates the
ETA, publishes the change to the customer, and triggers exception handling for
the most severe cases. High-value parcels get proactive outreach instead of
passive status updates, while standard parcels simply receive the revised ETA.

Notifications are event-driven and templated: out for delivery, delayed,
attempted, delivered, and exception. I would route them through the notification
service with per-channel preferences, and throttle so a customer does not
receive ten messages in an hour. Because delivery windows shift, the
notification includes the new window, and the system updates it when the route
re-plans rather than sending a second, contradictory message. Preferences also
matter for choice: some customers want SMS for every scan, others only for
exceptions.

The design principle is that every customer-facing ETA is derived from the same
plan the driver follows. Delays caused by weather or misloads flow through the
same delay engine, and the customer service console sees the same timeline a
customer sees, so a support agent can explain exactly what happened. Analytics
over delay causes feed back into capacity planning and promise-setting,
gradually making the promises more accurate rather than just apologizing for
them. A daily audit reconciles promised versus delivered windows and tracks
on-time percentage as the north-star metric.

## Answers

### Q1. Design a service discovery system

Service discovery answers one question: given a service name, which live
instances can I talk to? In a dynamic environment where instances are constantly
launched and terminated by autoscaling or deploys, hardcoding IP addresses
breaks, so the system maintains a registry mapping service names to instance
addresses with metadata such as version, zone, and capacity. Clients and
gateways consult the registry on startup and periodically afterward, and the
result is cached locally to keep the steady-state path fast.

The architecture splits into registration and resolution. Registration is
write-heavy and low-frequency per instance: a sidecar agent on each host
registers the local service, sends heartbeats, and deregisters on shutdown.
Resolution is read-heavy and latency-sensitive: the gateway or client library
queries the registry, caches the instance list, and applies its own load
balancing and retries. The registry itself is a replicated, strongly consistent
store, because a stale or split view of the instance list directly causes
routing errors, and it is fronted by a cache and a watch channel so that hot
paths never pay full registry cost.

A good design separates the data path from the control path. The registry is the
control path — it answers "what instances exist" and changes rarely in absolute
terms. The data path is the client-side cache plus a resolver that rechecks the
registry on failure or on TTL expiry. This matters for scale: millions of
clients re-resolving against a single registry would collapse it, so caching,
watches (push-based updates), and subscription batching keep the registry load
proportional to churn, not to request volume.

### Q2. How do services register themselves?

Registration is the lifecycle problem: the system must know when an instance
appears, when it is ready, and when it disappears. The cleanest pattern is the
sidecar agent. Each host runs an agent next to the service process; the agent
probes a local health endpoint, and once the service reports ready, the agent
registers the instance with the registry, including the IP, port, and metadata
like version, zone, and a unique instance id. Using a sidecar keeps registration
out of the application code and standardizes behavior across languages and
frameworks.

The ready distinction matters because a process that has bound a port is not the
same as a service that can serve traffic. Many systems therefore support two
signals: a startup registration that marks the instance as "pending" and a
readiness signal that moves it to "healthy". This prevents the classic
deployment bug where traffic arrives at an instance that is still warming caches
or loading models. Deregistration is equally important: on a graceful shutdown
the agent removes the instance and drains connections before exit, and the
registry assigns a short TTL to every registration so a crashed process is
removed automatically when its lease expires.

Duplicates and stale entries are handled through idempotent writes keyed by
instance id, so an agent that restarts overwrites its previous entry instead of
leaving a ghost. Version and environment metadata attached at registration
enables canary routing and blue-green deploys, because the resolver can filter
instances by label rather than treating the service name as a single homogeneous
pool.

### Q3. How do you keep the registry fresh?

Freshness is maintained by heartbeats plus active probing. The sidecar agent
sends a heartbeat to the registry on an interval (commonly a few seconds), and
the registry attaches a lease with a TTL a few multiples of that interval. If a
heartbeat does not renew the lease, the entry expires and the instance is
removed from the active set. This gives eventual consistency under crash: the
system converges on the correct instance list within roughly one TTL window.
Heartbeats should be cheap — a single small write batched by the agent — so that
churn does not become the dominant registry load.

Heartbeats alone are not enough because they only prove the process is alive,
not that it can serve traffic. The registry therefore pairs the passive
heartbeat signal with active health checks: a health checker probes each
instance over the network (TCP connect or HTTP endpoint) and flips its status
when a probe fails. The two mechanisms are complementary — heartbeats catch
process death fast, active probes catch a wedged or misbehaving process that is
still alive enough to heartbeat. Combined, the registry can distinguish
"registered but not ready", "healthy", and "unhealthy", and only healthy
instances are returned to resolvers.

Renewal pressure is reduced by making the registry store short-lived data: it is
a cache with a source of truth, not a durable database. Registration records are
recreated from heartbeats, so a registry replica that restarts rebuilds its view
from live agents rather than from disk. This also bounds staleness after a
partition heals, because both sides reconcile to the same lease semantics rather
than merging conflicting lists.

### Q4. How do clients resolve healthy instances?

Resolution happens on the client side and is layered to protect the registry. On
first use, the client asks the resolution service for the instance list of a
service name, receives the healthy instances with metadata, and caches it
locally with a TTL. Subsequent lookups are served from the cache, so steady-
state request traffic never touches the registry. On cache expiry, or when a
cached instance starts failing, the client re-resolves in the background.

Healthy means more than registered: the resolver filters on status from health
checks, and typically applies policy. Load-aware resolution weights instances by
reported capacity or recent latency so that slower or more loaded instances
receive less traffic. Zone affinity is common in multi-region deployments —
preferring instances in the same zone reduces latency and cross-zone bandwidth
costs — with the registry storing zone as metadata. The resolution service
returns a full list plus change metadata so clients can detect whether the set
actually changed instead of rebalancing on every refresh.

Watch-based updates complement the polling cache. The registry publishes change
events for a service (instance added, removed, or unhealthy), and the resolution
service forwards them to subscribed clients over a watch channel, usually a
long-lived connection. This collapses the freshness window from a polling
interval to near-zero for changes while keeping registry load proportional to
the number of distinct watched service names. The cache and the watch cover each
other's failure modes: a watch that silently drops still gets eventual
consistency through TTL refresh, and a cache miss is always a valid fallback to
the registry.

### Q5. How do you handle network partitions?

A partition is the moment when the registry's consistency model gets tested. The
registry is replicated with a quorum-based consensus protocol such as Raft, so a
partitioned minority cannot accept writes and stops admitting new registrations;
this prevents two disjoint halves of the network from believing they both own
the same service. The cost is that during a partition the minority side cannot
register new instances, so the design mitigates this by keeping registration
near the quorum and by preferring small, fast quorums for the registry itself.

Clients tolerate partitions through stale-read caching. When the registry is
unreachable, resolvers serve the last known instance list instead of erroring,
relying on TTL to bound staleness. During the outage, failed instances are
skipped via local health checks so the client does not send traffic to dead
replicas even with a stale list. The key insight is that the client's own
connection attempts are the fastest health signal, so a client that holds a
stale cache plus retry logic can keep serving while the registry heals.

After the partition heals, reconciliation is lease-based: expired entries are
dropped, surviving agents re-heartbeat, and the registry converges to the true
instance set without manual intervention. Health checks biased to fail closed —
an instance unreachable from the checker is marked unhealthy — ensure that
unreachable nodes are excluded rather than accidentally marked healthy. The
system therefore keeps three guarantees: registered instances are eventually
visible, failed instances are eventually removed, and during any disruption a
client always has a usable (if stale) view plus fast local failure detection.

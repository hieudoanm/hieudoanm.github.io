## Answers

### Q1. Design a web analytics platform

The platform is a high-volume data pipeline followed by a low-latency reporting
layer. On the ingest side, a JavaScript SDK on each site fires events
(pageviews, clicks, conversions) to an event collector; the collector validates
and batches events into an ingestion pipeline — a distributed log — and a stream
processor enriches them (IP-to-geo, user agent parsing, session stitching)
before writing raw events to an event store. Downstream, an aggregator rolls raw
events into pre-aggregated cubes (OLAP cubes keyed by time, dimension, and
metric), and the reporting API answers dashboard queries from those cubes. A
separate funnel analyzer runs segment and funnel computations, and a report
cache serves the most requested dashboards.

The architecture separates hot and cold paths. Raw events must be written
durably and cheaply at massive scale, so they land in a columnar event store
partitioned by time and by site/property; analytical queries never scan raw data
— they hit pre-aggregated cubes. This is a classic trade: keeping raw events
enables arbitrary retroactive queries and recomputation of any broken rollup,
but pre-aggregation is what makes interactive dashboards (seconds, not minutes)
possible. The system must also handle schema evolution: events grow new fields
as products ship, so the collector and stream processor treat the event schema
as versioned and store unknown fields in a dynamic column, letting dashboards
expose new dimensions without a pipeline migration.

### Q2. How do you collect and ingest billions of events per day?

Ingestion is built around cheap, durable writes. The collector is a horizontally
scaled, stateless edge tier that accepts batched events over HTTP(S), validates
them (size limits, required fields), and writes them to a distributed,
partitioned log (like Kafka) that holds days of data as a buffer. The stream
processor consumes partitions in parallel, enriches each event (geolocation,
session ID, user ID resolution), and writes enriched events to the event store —
a columnar store partitioned by time, so writes are append-only segment files
and scans are time-windowed. Batching is essential: the SDK buffers events
client-side and flushes on an interval or on page unload (with `sendBeacon` for
reliability), so the collector handles far fewer, larger requests than raw
per-event traffic.

The hard constraints are throughput and data loss. At billions of events per
day, any synchronous processing would bottleneck, so the collector writes
asynchronously and the log absorbs spikes; backpressure appears as lag, not as
dropped requests. To protect correctness, the SDK adds a client-generated event
ID, and the pipeline deduplicates by (event_id) at ingest, making at-least-once
delivery safe. Partitioning matters: events are partitioned by property and
approximate time so the aggregator can read contiguous ranges per property.
Monitoring tracks collector latency, log lag, and the ingest-to-storage drop
rate; because a single rogue site can generate a flash flood, the collector
enforces per-property rate limits and can drop or sample the worst offenders
without degrading everyone else.

### Q3. How do you aggregate metrics without losing accuracy?

Metrics (pageviews, sessions, conversions, revenue) are computed by rollups over
time dimensions. The aggregator consumes the event stream and increments
counters for every (property, dimension, granularity) combination, writing
pre-aggregated rows into an OLAP cube with multiple granularities (hour, day) so
dashboard time-ranges read a few rows instead of millions of events. To avoid
losing accuracy under load, aggregation must be exact where possible and
approximate only where it is justified. Counts and sums are exact because they
are simple increments; uniques (unique users, sessions) are the hard case — an
exact distinct count requires per-user state, which is expensive, so analytics
platforms use HyperLogLog, a probabilistic data structure that gives near-exact
uniques with constant memory, accepting a small, well-understood error
(~0.5–2%).

The cube and the raw store are kept consistent with a reconciliation loop. The
aggregator is at-least-once, so a failure can double-count; each rollup batch
carries the event ranges it covered, and a rewind/recompute mechanism can replay
a range over the raw event store to fix a bad aggregate. Late-arriving events (a
mobile SDK flushing hours later) are handled by re-aggregating the affected
hourly window rather than appending out-of-order, which would corrupt time
series. Accuracy is also preserved by dimension sparsity handling:
high-cardinality dimensions (URLs) are aggregated per distinct value only when
they matter, while the cube keeps the top-K plus an "(other)" bucket. Sampling
is reserved for the deepest, least-visited drill-downs, clearly labeled so
analysts know when numbers are estimates.

### Q4. How do you run funnel and cohort queries fast?

Funnel and cohort queries are not simple rollups — they are multi-step queries
over ordered user events. A funnel ("users who viewed, added to cart, then
purchased") requires joining events per user in sequence and computing how many
reached each step; a cohort ("users who signed up in March, what was their
30-day retention?") requires grouping users by acquisition time and measuring
subsequent behavior. The funnel analyzer precomputes both: for funnels it builds
per-user event sequences in the event store and runs a windowed join (e.g., a
sliding-window or session-window aggregation) that assembles each user's ordered
steps, then aggregates the transition counts step by step. For cohorts, it
builds a retention matrix offline — for each acquisition day, the count of users
active on each subsequent day — so a dashboard cohort chart reads the matrix
instead of scanning events.

Speed comes from precomputation and columnar layout. Funnel results are cached
per (funnel definition, time range); cohort matrices are materialized daily.
Queries over the cube use columnar scans that touch only the needed columns and
partitions. The trade-off is definition flexibility: precomputed funnels are
fast but lock you into a fixed step definition, so the platform offers both —
precomputed funnel IDs for common paths and an ad-hoc mode that runs a smaller,
time-bounded computation over raw events for exploration, with a timeout and a
hint to save it as a custom funnel. Because users are the join key, the raw
event store is partitioned by user hash within the time range, so the sequence
assembly for a funnel stays on a bounded number of shards rather than scanning
everything.

### Q5. How do you generate and cache dashboard reports?

Dashboards are the read path, and they are served almost entirely from
precomputed data. The reporting API resolves each dashboard widget to an OLAP
cube query, executes it over the aggregated cube, and renders a response; the
most popular dashboards are additionally cached in a report cache (e.g., Redis
or a CDN-style cache) keyed by (property, widget, time range, filters,
granularity), with TTLs matched to the cube's refresh cadence. On cache miss,
the API serves the cube and asynchronously repopulates the cache, so a hot
dashboard's steady-state traffic never touches the cube. Cache invalidation is
time-based rather than event-based — the cube refreshes on a schedule (e.g.,
every few minutes for the current day, hourly for older data), and the cache TTL
is aligned to that schedule to avoid serving stale mid-refresh numbers.

Correctness and cost trade off here. The dashboard must not flicker: the cube's
aggregator writes a new day-partition and swaps atomically, so readers always
see either the previous complete state or the new one, never a partial hour.
Cache hits return instantly, but the fill process must avoid a thundering herd
when a widget's cache expires — a single in-flight computation with other
requesters waiting on the same key. Since most sites are small, the cube is
dominated by a few massive properties; those are partitioned per property with
their own cube shards and cache budgets, so a noisy neighbor can't evict
everyone's reports. Monitoring tracks cache hit rate, cube query latency, and
staleness per property, and a drift check periodically compares cube aggregates
against the raw event store to catch silent rollup bugs.

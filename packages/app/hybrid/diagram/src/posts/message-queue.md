## Answers

### Q1. Design a distributed message queue (Kafka-style)

At its core a Kafka-style queue is an append-only, ordered log. Producers
publish records to a named topic, which is split into ordered partitions, each
hosted on exactly one broker in a broker cluster. Partitions are the unit of
parallelism and replication: each is copied to several brokers (leader/follower)
for durability, and a coordinator manages cluster metadata (ZooKeeper or KRaft),
assigns partitions to brokers, and tracks consumer group membership. The
coordinator also elects a leader for each partition and maintains a set of
in-sync replicas (ISR) — replicas current enough to take over seamlessly.

On the write path, a producer first queries the coordinator to discover which
broker leads each partition, then sends batched records to the leader, which
appends them to the partition log and replicates to followers before
acknowledging according to the `acks` setting. Each appended record receives a
monotonically increasing `offset` — its position in the log. Consumers subscribe
within a consumer group: each partition is consumed by exactly one group member,
which reads sequentially and periodically commits its offset so it can resume
after a crash. Records are immutable; retention is time- or size-based.

The data model is a hierarchy: topic → partition → record
`(key, value, headers, timestamp, offset)`. A producer's key hashes to a
partition, which is how ordering-by-key and parallelism are obtained; throughput
is bounded by partition count, so you size partitions up front for the peak
write rate and the consumer parallelism you plan to run. Kafka deliberately
trades per-record indexing for sequential I/O — brokers never index individual
messages, relying on the OS page cache and read-ahead for throughput — which
makes random access to one message slow. Failure handling: when a leader dies, a
follower from the ISR is elected, lagging replicas are excluded from the ISR and
cannot become leader, and records that exceed retry limits are diverted to a
dead letter queue so a poison message never stalls a consumer.

### Q2. How do you guarantee ordering within a partition?

Ordering exists only within a partition, and it is a total order. A producer
hashes its key to a partition, so all records sharing that key land in the same
partition, and the leader appends them to the log in arrival order, assigning
sequential offsets. A consumer reads a partition strictly sequentially with a
single thread, so it observes records in exactly the order the leader wrote
them. This makes the partition the natural place to implement per-entity
ordering: in a payment pipeline, all events for one order carry the same key and
are therefore processed in order.

Preserving that order end to end means batching and retries must never reorder.
With an idempotent producer, the broker tracks a producer ID and per-partition
sequence numbers, so retried batches are deduplicated and are inserted into the
log before any later batch — a retry can never land after a subsequent record.
The broker also refuses concurrent in-flight requests to the same partition
unless idempotence is disabled, which forces the producer to serialize writes
per partition. On the read side, a consumer that commits offset N has already
processed every offset `< N`, so a restart replays only from the committed
offset; records are immutable, so a re-read yields identical data.

The price of ordering is parallelism. If you need a global order across all keys
you must use a single-partition topic, which caps throughput at one broker's
sequential write rate. Ordering and scale are in direct tension: partitions
enable parallel writes and reads, and any cross-partition order is lost. The
standard design therefore guarantees order per key, within a partition, with the
consumer group enforcing exactly one member per partition, and you never
parallelize consumption inside a partition when order matters. If a consumer
later needs to repartition state (for example, joining by key), you rebuild it
from a compacted changelog topic rather than reordering the primary log.

### Q3. How do you ensure durability and replay (offsets)?

Durability has two layers: the leader's local log and replication. With
`acks=all`, the leader waits until every in-sync replica has persisted a batch
before acknowledging the producer, so an acknowledged record survives any
single-broker crash; a follower from the ISR is promoted in its place.
Replication factor 3 spread across failure domains is the standard posture. The
partition log itself is immutable and write-sequential — records are appended,
never edited — and retention is time- or size-based, which is exactly what makes
replay possible: nothing is purged before the retention window says so.

Replay is built on offsets. Every record has a stable offset within its
partition log, and consumers commit checkpoints of the offset they last finished
processing, stored in a compacted internal topic (`__consumer_offsets`). On
restart or partition reassignment, the consumer seeks to its committed offset
and re-reads from there; because the log is immutable, the re-read yields the
same records. Commit timing defines the semantics: commit after processing, and
a crash between processing and commit redelivers (at-least-once, duplicates
possible); commit before processing, and a crash loses records (at-most-once).
Most systems choose at-least-once and make consumers idempotent so duplicates
are harmless.

For long-lived streams, retention interacts with replay: once the log trims old
segments, you cannot seek before the retained offset, so the replay window is
bounded by retention settings. For high-churn keys, log compaction replaces pure
time/size retention — the log keeps at least the latest value per key, giving an
effective "current state" stream you can replay. Operationally, a replica that
falls too far behind re-syncs from a snapshot rather than replaying the whole
log, and consumers should be tested against rebalancing: seeking to the
committed offset after a partition move is the mechanism that prevents both loss
and duplication across handovers.

### Q4. How do consumers scale and handle rebalancing?

Consumers join a consumer group, and the coordinator assigns each partition to
exactly one member. That yields the scaling model: throughput scales as
partitions × consumers, because each partition is consumed by a single thread,
and you add consumers up to the partition count — beyond it they idle. Note the
log/queue distinction: records are not deleted after reading, so many groups can
read the same topic independently (pub/sub), while within one group the
partition assignment makes it a work stream. Partitions are therefore sized up
front for both peak write rate and the consumer parallelism you plan to run.

Rebalancing occurs when a member joins, leaves, stalls, or crashes. The
coordinator detects failure via heartbeats and a session timeout, computes a new
assignment, and tells members to revoke and re-acquire partitions. The classic
eager protocol stops the whole group and re-reads, which is disruptive when
membership churns; cooperative-sticky rebalancing reassigns only the partitions
that changed, letting everyone else keep consuming. Members commit offsets
before revoking and seek to the committed offset on reassignment, so no
partition loses or duplicates records across the handover — at-least-once, with
the rare overlap absorbed by idempotent consumers.

Operationally, the pitfalls are self-inflicted rebalances. Consumers that take
longer than `max.poll.interval.ms` between polls are considered dead, triggering
churn; too many consumers, noisy membership, or slow batch processing cause
constant rebalancing that stalls the whole group. Monitor rebalance frequency
and consumer lag, and prefer the cooperative-sticky assignor when rebalances are
frequent. Ordering is preserved during a rebalance because a partition is never
assigned to two members at once — the coordinator's assignment is a strict
one-to-one mapping, and any transition keeps one member responsible until the
other has revoked.

### Q5. How do you handle at-least-once vs exactly-once semantics?

By default Kafka delivers at-least-once: a consumer that commits after
processing re-reads from the committed offset, so a crash mid-batch redelivers
records. Exactly-once requires both sides. On the producer side, enable
idempotent producers: each batch carries a producer ID and sequence number, so
the broker dedupes retried batches and writes each record once — exactly-once
within a single partition. To extend this across a pipeline, use transactions
(KIP-98): the producer marks a transactional batch, consumers read only
committed transactions, and the consumer's offset commit and its processing
results land in the same transaction, so a crash cannot desync what was
processed from what was committed.

Those tools make exactly-once possible only within a Kafka-to-Kafka pipeline.
The moment a consumer writes to an external store, exactly-once becomes an
end-to-end distributed transaction problem: you need idempotency keys in the
sink, or you must write the record and the consumer state together in the target
database. The pragmatic answer is to design for at-least-once end to end, keep
consumers idempotent, and retain an audit trail so duplicates are detectable and
safe — reserving Kafka transactions for the small set of flows that truly need
them.

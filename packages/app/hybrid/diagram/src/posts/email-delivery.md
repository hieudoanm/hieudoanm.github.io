## Answers

### Q1. Design an email delivery service

The service accepts a send request from an app, renders the email from a
template, validates the recipient addresses, and hands the message to a queue. A
fleet of sending agents consumes the queue and speaks SMTP to the receiving
infrastructure (the recipient's MX servers), then tracks delivery, bounce, and
open/click outcomes. The data plane is linear: Send API → template render →
address validation → send queue → sending agent → SMTP → bounce and tracking
feedback. Around it sit the reputation store, which records sender health, and
an analytics pipeline that turns delivery events into reports.

The design choices are dominated by deliverability rather than raw throughput.
Sending agents hold dedicated sender IPs and pool them by sender identity;
messages are grouped by recipient domain and routed through separate IP pools so
one abusive customer cannot poison another's reputation. Every message gets a
unique message ID; tracking pixels and click links log opens and clicks. Bounce
handling differentiates hard from soft bounces — hard bounces (permanent, e.g.,
unknown address) suppress the address, soft bounces (transient, e.g., mailbox
full) are retried with backoff. The result is a system where delivery is
observable end to end and where every sending decision is mediated by
reputation, not just by SMTP mechanics. The queue is the reliability backbone:
it is durable and at-least-once, so a sender-agent crash redelivers the message,
and the delivery state machine (queued, sent, delivered, bounced, complained) is
the single model that analytics, reputation, and the customer portal all read
from.

### Q2. How do you ensure high deliverability?

Deliverability is not a single feature; it is a set of practices across the
whole stack. At the protocol level the service must pass authentication so
receivers trust the mail: SPF (the sending IP is authorized for the domain),
DKIM (the message is signed with a domain key), and DMARC (receivers know what
to do with authentication failures). Without all three, major providers
increasingly reject or quarantine mail regardless of content. Content matters
too: rendering from validated templates, linking to real unsubscribe pages, and
keeping a healthy image-to-text ratio reduce spam-filter classification risk.
Replies and feedback loops must be accepted, because providers score domains
partly on responsiveness.

Operationally, sending must be gentle. The service rate-limits per domain and
per IP, honoring the limits the receiver states; it backs off on transient SMTP
errors with exponential retry and rotates retries across IP pools. IP warming
ramps new sending IPs from small to full volume over weeks so receivers build a
trust history instead of seeing a sudden flood. Keep-alives and TLS make the
SMTP sessions themselves reliable, and DNS records (MX, PTR for the IP, SPF,
DKIM, DMARC) are validated before a pool can send. Finally, the feedback loop
closes the circle: bounces, complaints, and spam-trap hits flow back into
suppression lists and the reputation store, so a sender that repeatedly fails is
automatically throttled before damage spreads to the pool. Monitoring ties it
together: per-provider delivery rates, deferral codes, and time-to-inbox are
graphed per pool, and a sustained drop in a provider's acceptance rate fires an
alert so a reputation change is caught within hours, not weeks.

### Q3. How do you manage sender reputation?

Sender reputation is stored per sending identity — a combination of sender IP,
sending domain, and customer — in the reputation store, updated from delivery
outcomes. The core metric is a rolling window of hard-bounce rate, complaint
rate, spam-trap hits, and unknown-user rate, compared against thresholds (common
targets: under 2–3% bounces, under 0.1% complaints). Reputation is domain- and
IP-specific, so the service maintains separate pools: a new customer starts on a
low-volume pool with a warming schedule, graduates to the shared pool as their
numbers improve, and is confined to an isolated pool or quarantined when their
numbers degrade. A sending IP never changes owner, because an IP's history is
its identity.

Reputation is managed proactively, not just reactively. The control plane
applies per-pool sending limits, rotates IPs within a pool to avoid single-IP
overload, and pauses a pool entirely when complaint or bounce rates spike. Bad
actors are isolated so their problems never affect shared IPs. Reputation also
feeds routing decisions: high-reputation traffic can use more aggressive
parallelism and higher per-domain concurrency, while questionable traffic is
throttled. Because reputation data changes slowly, it is cached and consulted on
every send — cheap checks that prevent one bad day from becoming a blocked
domain, and that let the service trade short-term throughput for long-term
deliverability across the whole fleet. Reputation data also feeds the sender
portal: customers see their bounce, complaint, and spam-trap rates against
thresholds, so a customer can correct list-hygiene issues before the platform
has to throttle them.

### Q4. How do you handle bounces and complaints?

Every SMTP response is classified by the bounce handler. Hard bounces (5xx
permanent, e.g., "user does not exist") suppress the address globally and notify
the customer: the address is added to a global suppression list so no future
campaign can target it. Soft bounces (4xx transient: full mailbox, greylisting,
rate limiting) are retried with exponential backoff and a maximum retry window
(often 24–72 hours), after which they are classified as failed and reported.
Each attempt is logged with the exact SMTP code so analytics can distinguish
causes — a spike in a particular 4xx code points to a specific provider policy
change, not a blanket deliverability problem.

Complaints arrive via the complaint feedback loop — providers post abuse reports
to a feedback endpoint — and via the unsubscribe link, both feeding the same
suppression list. Suppression is the critical safety property: a suppressed
address must never be emailed again by any sender in the service, checked
synchronously at send time against a cached suppression index. Spam traps
(honeypot addresses) are tracked separately because hitting them is stronger
evidence of list-acquisition problems than ordinary bounces. The handler
publishes every outcome as an event to analytics, so a customer sees delivered,
bounced, complained, and suppressed counts per campaign rather than a single
"sent" number — and the reputation store consumes the same events to score the
sender. Suppression lists are versioned and exportable so customers can keep
their own lists in sync, and each record stores its reason (hard bounce,
complaint, unsubscribe) so a marketing team can tell a dead address from an
angry one.

### Q5. How do you prevent your service being used for spam?

Abuse prevention starts at intake. Sending requires verified sender identity:
the customer must prove domain ownership via a DNS record before sending from
that domain, and every send must carry a valid DKIM signature for a verified
domain. The template service renders only from configured templates with
mandatory unsubscribe and physical-address footer blocks, so customers cannot
strip compliance content. Address validation at send time catches syntactically
bad, disposable, and obviously harvested addresses before they ever reach the
queue, and new accounts are rate-limited until they build a history.

Detection runs continuously on behavior. The reputation store flags new domains
that ramp too fast, unusual spike patterns, and high complaint or bounce ratios,
and the control plane throttles or quarantines them. The send queue is
partitioned per customer with per-identity rate limits, so a burst from one
customer cannot overwhelm shared IPs or receiving providers. Finally, the
service enforces hard policies at the edges: suppression lists are checked
synchronously on every send, unsubscribes are processed within the regulatory
window, and customers who persistently generate complaints are suspended. These
layers — verified identity, filtered content, throttled volume, and
reputation-driven isolation — make the service unattractive for bulk abuse while
keeping the send path fast for legitimate senders. The controls are enforced
synchronously in the Send API, not just as background checks: verification,
suppression lookup, and quota checks run before a message is accepted, so abuse
never even enters the queue. Over time these synchronous checks also produce a
rich dataset of rejected requests that sharpens the behavioral models, making
the service progressively harder to abuse.

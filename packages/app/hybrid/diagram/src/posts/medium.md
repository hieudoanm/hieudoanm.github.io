- How do you measure and surface engagement (claps)?

## Answers

### Q1. Design Medium / a blogging platform

Medium combines a writing and editor backend, a publish service, a following
feed, and a discovery layer. The API gateway separates the read-heavy browse
path from the write path. The Editor Service manages drafts with debounced
autosave and revision history; the Post Service handles publishing and
persistence to Posts DB, then the Notifications service fans out to followers.
The Feed Service builds the reader's feed from the Following Graph, while the
Recommendations service injects candidate posts scored by tag affinity; the Tag
Index powers tag browse and trends. Posts store structured JSON content plus
rendered HTML, so the reader page is served almost entirely from cache.

Key constraints: article content is far larger than a tweet yet is consumed in a
social-feed pattern, so reads dominate by orders of magnitude while publishes
are bursty and rare. Drafts must never be lost — every keystroke snapshot is
durably persisted and reconciled on reconnect — while feed ranking is explicitly
eventually consistent. Availability is the priority on the reader path; a single
miss falls back to a DB read with the cache primed asynchronously. Scale
estimates: millions of MAU, tens of thousands of reads per second, publishing at
a tiny fraction of that, and clap writes landing somewhere between the two.

### Q2. How do you design the writing and publishing flow?

The editor is a client-side rich-text application; every keystroke produces an
operational snapshot serialized as a structured JSON document model, not raw
HTML. Debounced autosave pushes the latest snapshot to the Editor Service, which
stores each revision and keeps a configurable history (e.g. 30 days). Drafts are
private by default; a draft row holds status (`draft` / `published`), a unique
slug, and a pointer to revision objects in object storage. Publishing is an
explicit state transition: validate the document, run a link-unfurl and
image-upload step, render HTML, set `status=published`, backfill the tag index
and search index, then fire the follower notification. An idempotency key on the
publish request prevents double-publishes.

The write path is fast because the document writes to a durable log/store
immediately while HTML rendering happens asynchronously; the post is only served
publicly once rendering completes and the cache is primed. Crashes mid-edit
recover from the last snapshot with an undo/redo log. Trade-off: client-side
snapshot sync is complex, but a per-keystroke server API would multiply latency
and storage cost; diffing snapshots keeps payloads small. Concurrency is handled
with optimistic locking on `updated_at`; Medium is single-author, so
last-write-wins plus a revision log is enough — a multi-editor collaborative
model would need OT/CRDT.

### Q3. Design a following feed with recommendations

Pull-based fanout fits Medium well: authors are few relative to readers, and
each user follows a modest set of authors, so at read time the Feed Service
merges the latest posts of the followed authors from the Following Graph — a
sparse adjacency list of `(follower_id, author_id)` edges. The merge reads each
author's recent posts via an `(author_id, created_at)` index and interleaves
recommendation candidates. Results are cached per user with a short TTL
(minutes) so new posts surface quickly; invalidation fires when a followed
author publishes.

Recommendations score candidate posts by author similarity to the user's
followed set (collaborative filtering over co-followed authors), tag affinity
from reading history, and engagement signals (claps, read ratio, dwell time).
Cold-start users fall back to trending-by-tag and global popularity. Trade-offs:
pure push fanout would flood the notification pipeline and waste writes on a
platform where most follows are passive — pull keeps write amplification near
zero at the cost of a per-read merge, which the cache absorbs. The feed supports
two tabs — Following (strictly chronological merge) and For You (scored) —
sharing the same per-user cache layer with different scoring paths.

### Q4. How do you build discovery (tags, topics, trends)?

Tags are first-class entities (id, slug); posts link to many tags through a join
table, and the Tag Index maintains per-tag sorted lists of post ids by recency
and score. Discovery surfaces three things: tag browse (all recent posts in a
tag), topic pages (curated bundles of tags), and trends (tags and posts whose
velocity has spiked). Velocity is measured from a rolling window of claps,
reads, and new-post counts aggregated in a stream processor; a trend score is
the current rate relative to baseline (z-score-style), so a consistently popular
tag does not permanently dominate the trending slots.

The browse path reads from cache: each tag has a sorted-set cache of post ids
refreshed by the ranking worker, and topic pages are composed from their
constituent tags' cached lists. Trending is recomputed every few minutes and
cached globally since only a small number of trend slots exist. Trade-offs: tag
cardinality is high but per-tag write rates are low, so per-tag cached lists
scale fine; trends need fresh signal, so they bypass long TTLs and tolerate
recompute cost. Trend manipulation is mitigated by requiring velocity to come
from a diverse user set, reusing the vote-fraud signal pipeline.

### Q5. How do you measure and surface engagement (claps)?

Claps are Medium's engagement currency: one user can clap 1–50 times per post.
The vote path records `(user_id, post_id, clap_count)` idempotently — a user can
clap a post at most once, with repeated taps accumulating into that single event
— and aggregates into per-post totals. The number displayed is a denormalized
count updated by an aggregation worker; the per-user events are kept separately
for audits and fraud checks. Claps are the dominant ranking feature, feeding
both the post's own score and the recommendation engine's training signal.

The Claps Service rate-limits per user, dedupes session claps, and streams
events to analytics; ranking weights claps but blends in read time and read
ratio so a spammy-clap burst does not inflate a post. Surfacing: clap counts
appear on cards in the feed, tag browse, and the post page, and "most clapped"
lists are precomputed by the worker. Failure handling: a clap arriving during an
outage is queued and replayed; counts are eventually consistent, so the UI shows
an approximate total immediately and reconciles within seconds.

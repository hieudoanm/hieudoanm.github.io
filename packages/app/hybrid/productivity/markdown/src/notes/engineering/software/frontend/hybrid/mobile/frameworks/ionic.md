This framework combines **5W1H** with **Good Prompt principles** (**Clear role ·
Clear format · Clear goal · Clear context · Clear examples**) and clearly
separates **context-owned** vs **user-owned** responsibilities.

The key idea: 👉 **The context controls quality and consistency** 👉 **The user
controls intent, meaning, and constraints**

---

## 🏗️ Context-owned

> These sections are **owned by the prompt context**.  
> They should always exist to guarantee **predictable, production-grade
> outputs**.

---

### 👤 Who (Role / Persona)

> Who should the AI act as?

#### Default Persona (Recommended)

- You are a **senior mobile engineer specializing in Ionic**
- Think like a **cross-platform tech lead**
- Assume **production usage by default**
- Balance **web standards, performance, and mobile UX**

#### Expected Expertise

- Ionic Framework (latest stable)
- TypeScript
- Web Components
- Ionic + Angular / React / Vue
- Capacitor (native integrations)
- Mobile UX patterns
- Performance tuning on mobile WebViews
- Cross-platform architecture

✅ Sets **engineering depth, bias, and trade-offs**  
⚠️ Should always be present (ideally via `.cursor/rules.md`)

---

### 🛠️ How (Format / Constraints / Style)

> How should the response be delivered?

#### 📦 Format / Output

- Use **TypeScript + Ionic code snippets**
- Clearly separate:
  - `pages / screens`
  - `components`
  - `services`
  - `state`
- Use:
  - Escaped code blocks for all code
  - Bullet points for explanations
  - Tables for trade-offs when useful

---

#### ⚙️ Constraints (Ionic Best Practices)

- Ionic **latest stable**
- TypeScript **strict mode**
- Prefer **Capacitor** over Cordova
- Follow platform design guidelines (iOS & Android)
- Avoid DOM-heavy components
- Avoid blocking the main thread
- Avoid inline styles; use Ionic theming
- Avoid hardcoded environment values
- Externalize configuration
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys

---

#### 🧱 Architecture & Design Rules

- Feature-based folder structure
- Business logic lives in services, not components
- Components should remain thin and declarative
- Unidirectional data flow
- Centralize API and native plugin access
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep platform-specific logic isolated

---

#### 🔐 Security & Validation

- Validate all user input
- Never trust client-side data
- Securely store tokens using Capacitor Secure Storage
- Do not expose secrets in the app bundle
- Handle authentication and authorization explicitly
- Gracefully handle permission denials

---

#### 🧪 Reliability & Maintainability

- Small, focused components
- Predictable lifecycle usage
- Explicit loading, error, and empty states
- Avoid side effects during render
- Log at integration boundaries
- Explain _why_ when trade-offs exist
- Prefer clarity over clever hacks

---

#### 📝 Explanation Style

- Concise and practical
- Explain architectural decisions briefly
- Avoid unnecessary theory unless requested

✅ Controls **code quality, consistency, and usability**  
📝 This section is ideal for `.cursor/rules.md`

---

## ✍️ User-owned

> These sections must come from the user.  
> They represent **intent, goals, and real-world constraints** that cannot be
> inferred.

---

### 📌 What (Task / Action)

> What do you want the AI to do?

Examples:

- Build an Ionic page
- Integrate a Capacitor plugin
- Refactor an Ionic app
- Debug a platform-specific issue
- Design Ionic app architecture

✅ Defines the **core engineering task**  
👉 Always required

---

### 🎯 Why (Intent / Goal)

> Why are you asking? What’s the desired outcome?

Examples:

- Improve maintainability
- Fix mobile performance issues
- Establish team standards
- Prepare for store submission

✅ Guides **depth, trade-offs, and prioritization**

---

### 📍 Where (Context / Situation)

> In what technical context does this apply?

Examples:

- Ionic + Angular vs React
- iOS / Android / Web
- Offline-first vs online-only
- Greenfield vs legacy app

⚠️ Optional, but highly impactful

---

### ⏰ When (Time / Phase / Lifecycle)

> When is this being used?

Examples:

- MVP
- Production release
- Refactor phase
- Bug-fix sprint

⚠️ Optional, but helps tune rigor and risk

# Mobile Engineering AI Rules — Ionic

You are a senior mobile engineer specializing in Ionic. Think like a tech lead
building production-grade cross-platform apps.

## Technology

- Ionic (latest)
- TypeScript
- Capacitor

## Core Principles

- Assume production usage by default
- Prefer web standards and clarity
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions

## Architecture

- Thin components, logic in services
- Feature-based structure
- Unidirectional data flow

## Performance

- Avoid unnecessary DOM updates
- Be mindful of WebView constraints
- Optimize for mobile devices

## Security

- Never hardcode secrets
- Secure token storage
- Validate all user input

## Code Style

- Small, focused components
- Meaningful naming
- Predictable life cycles
```

### 2️⃣ User Prompt Template (Paste into Cursor Chat)

```text
Task:
[Describe exactly what you want to build, review, debug, or design.]

Why it matters:
[Explain the goal, outcome, or decision this should support.]

Where this applies:
[Describe the app, platforms, and constraints.]
(Optional)

When this is needed:
[Project phase, urgency, or lifecycle stage.]
(Optional)
```

---

### ✅ Fully Filled Example

```text
Task:
Implement an Ionic page that displays a list of orders with pull-to-refresh and offline support.

Why it matters:
This page will be reused across the app and should demonstrate clean architecture and good mobile UX practices.

Where this applies:
An Ionic + React app targeting iOS and Android using Capacitor.

When this is needed:
For an MVP release where stability and clarity are more important than advanced animations.
```

## 🧠 Why This Ordering Works

- **Who → How** sets the engineering mindset and quality bar
- **What → Why** defines intent and success criteria
- **Where → When** tunes architecture, depth, and risk tolerance

> **Files define behavior.  
> Prompts define intent.  
> Context makes the answer production-ready.**

Happy Ionic Prompting ⚡📱🚀
